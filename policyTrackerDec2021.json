VAWA 2013 did not apply to Alaska Native villages with the exception of 2 tribes, so allowing Alaska Native villages to be covered by the proposed legislation was a critical change. \n- Also changed from VAWA 2018 is the name “Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ)” which is now proposed as “Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction,” thus providing a clarification as to who these provisions are for (tribal communities)\n- New VAWA legislation responds to concerns raised by the National Congress of American Indians, as well as other community members, regarding the number of tribes that can implement SDVCJ because of the costs of meeting Congressionally delegated standards. The new version of VAWA proposes the allocation of $ to tribal communities.\n- This bill has expanded tribal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous offenders for crimes which were not previously included in the SDVCJ of the 2013 reauthorization. These include trafficking, child abuse, child witness of abuse, stalking, sexual assault, elder abuse, and assault against law enforcement.",

The Pilot Project, in accordance with the Justice Department’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP) Initiative, and in furtherance of and Savanna’s Act, implements tailored Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRP) in select pilot sites across Alaska.",
    "UIC Pros": "- Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs) will be locally tailored, with ample opportunity for tribal input\n- Explicit mention of preventative measures, survivor services, and educational programs that can be implemented across Alaska to reduce rates of violence against and within Indigenous communities\n- Formulation of TCRP’s utilizes a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, with the structure of these plans centering Indigenous populations, oftentimes left out by legislation, on a community level. \n- The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures\n- With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e. police departments), it is likely law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before.",
    "UIC Cons": "- The language within disseminated information regarding the TCRP’s still appears reactive to MMIP, rather than addressing root causes of ongoing violence. \n- The heavy policy emphasis on collaboration with law enforcement may limit the kinds of \"justice\" that can come from these community response plans.",

    "Summary": "Creates the Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women. \"Provides that the Task Force must examine and report on the following: (1) the systemic causes behind violence that Chicago women and girls experience, including patterns and underlying factors that explain why disproportionately high levels of violence occur against Chicago women and girls, including underlying historical, social, economic, institutional, and cultural factors that may contribute to the violence; (2) appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Chicago women and girls, including data on missing and murdered Chicago women and girls; (3) policies and institutions such as policing, child welfare, medical examiner practices, and other governmental practices that impact violence against Chicago women and girls and the investigation and prosecution of crimes of gender-related violence against Chicago residents; (4) measures necessary to address and reduce violence against Chicago women and girls; and (5) measures to help victims, victims' families, and victims' communities prevent and heal from violence that occurs against Chicago women and girls. Provides that the Task Force shall report annually to the General Assembly and the Governor on the work of the Task Force.\" (introduced 2/25/21)",
    "UIC Pros": "- Task force is convened indefinitely, with a mandate to report annually in requiring reports to the General Assembly and the Governor on the work of the Task Force.\n- Bill mandates for the examination of the systemic causes behind violence that Chicago women and girls experience, including underlying historical, social, economic, institutional, and cultural patterns and underlying factors that explain why disproportionately high levels of violence occur against Chicago women and girls\n- Bill possesses other commendable mandates, such as the directive to research and report on appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Chicago women and girls, including data on missing and murdered Chicago women and girls",
    "UIC Cons": "- Co-opts language of MMIP advocacy without actually mentioning indigeneity. Further, there is no mention of race and the ways this can enhance the disparate impacts of the missing and murdered crisis. As such, if there is potential to impact urban Indigenous populations in the Chicago area, it will only be by incident or by chance. \n- No language stipulating the requirement of cultural relevance of services or approaches\n- Language is not inclusive of gender diversity\n- Bill disproportionately centers law enforcement and Chicago bureaucracy, prioritizing knowledge from police and governmental institutions over the lived experiences of indigenous people, failing to center Indigenous voices and perspectives.\n- Reach of this legislation is limited, impacting only Indigenous communities within the Chicago area, not Indigenous populations statewide.",

    "UIC Cons": "- Bill provides financial resources to law enforcement, who have thus far failed to respond to the ongoing MMIP crisis due to a multitude of factors. Training cops is ineffectual because not only does this fail to address the root causes of the colonial and state violence that has fueled the MMIP crisis, but this obscures the structural and material constraints of addressing the impunity with which violence against Indigenous populations is waged. \n- Legislation appears to weaponize the MMIP crisis, using this as an opportunity to strengthen the very law enforcement that has inflicted violence upon Indigenous communities for generations.\n- Fails to provide material support for, or sufficient centering of, Indigenous communities, survivors, and relatives of the ongoing MMIP crisis.",

This language is critical, as “man camps” are especially prevalent in states with economies dominated by resource extraction like Louisiana\n- Stipulates action items such as quarterly reports (but only for legislation period of 2 yrs) and provides for pursuit of prevention measures.\n- Legislation calls for cultural competency within sexual violence trainings",

Clarifying information that the task force must report and providing financial appropiations (passed 4/19/21)                                                                                                                                              *Both MT HB98 and MT SB4 (as amended version of HB98) lay out the requirements for task force membership, and the primary duties of the task force, including work to identify strategies to improve interagency communication, cooperation, and collaboration to remove jurisdictional barriers and increase reporting and investigation of missing indigenous persons, work to identify causes that contribute to missing and murdered indigenous persons and make recommendations to federally recognized tribes in the state to reduce cases of missing and murdered indigenous persons, prepare a written written report of findings and recommendations for submission to the state-tribal relations interim committee, and to administer the looping in native communities network grant program (as amended).",
    "UIC Pros": "- Bill is structured to require regular reporting of findings and recommendations\n- Requires moderate levels of Indigenous representation with representatives from each tribe in Montana, however only representatives from federally recognized tribes are recognized.   \n- Provides financial support for the task force through allocation of funds\n- Aims include promoting communication, cooperation, and collaboration to remove jurisdictional barriers and increase reporting and investigation of missing Indigenous persons as well as work to identify causes that contribute to missing and murdered Indigenous persons (such as annual reporting of the characteristics of missing indigenous persons) with the hopes of creating policy and recommendations to reduce cases of MMIP. In this way there is encouraging attention paid to prevention.",
    "UIC Cons": "- May preclude authentic Indigenous representation because task force members must be appointed by Attorney General, in this way the legislation falls short in centering the voices of survivors and relatives\n- Legislative language alludes that recommendations will be made to federally recognized tribes in the state to reduce cases of missing and murdered indigenous persons, however this serves to obscure the structural conditions facilitating and motivating the ongoing MMIP crisis, even suggesting that tribal communities are, themselves, to blame for the violence waged against their Indigenous populations.",

    "UIC Pros": "- Bill utilizes gender inclusive language, mentions preventative efforts and is sponsored by a Native American state senator.  \n- Bill is structured to require regular reporting of findings and recommendations\n- Requires moderate levels of Indigenous representation with representatives from each tribe in Montana, however only representatives from federally recognized tribes are recognized.\n- Aims include promoting communication, cooperation, and collaboration to remove jurisdictional barriers and increase reporting and investigation of missing Indigenous persons as well as work to identify causes that contribute to missing and murdered Indigenous persons (such as annual reporting of the characteristics of missing Indigenous persons) with the hopes of creating policy and recommendations to reduce cases of MMIP. In this way there is encouraging attention paid to prevention.",
    "UIC Cons": "- The legislation lacks a structure that calls for the inclusion or centering of survivors or relatives of MMIP on the task force. The bill generally fails to amplify voices from the Indigenous community.\n- Legislative language alludes that recommendations will be made to federally recognized tribes in the state to reduce cases of missing and murdered indigenous persons, however this serves to obscure the structural conditions facilitating and motivating the ongoing MMIP crisis, even suggesting that tribal communities are, themselves, to blame for the violence waged against their Indigenous populations.   \n- May preclude authentic Indigenous representation because task force members must be appointed by Attorney General, in this way the legislation falls short in centering the voices of survivors and relatives",

    "Summary": "Extending the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force, Appropriating money and declaring an emergency.",
    "UIC Pros": "- Money is allocated to cover any expenses incurred by the task force ($50K)\n- Indigneous lawmakers have sponsored this legislation\n- Policy language declares MMIP as a state of emergency for Indigenous women\n- Legislation requires one victim or relative of MMIP on the task force (although limiting the contributions that could be made by a survivor’s perspective)\n- Action items are stipulated, as the task force is required to report a summary of its work, policy recommendations and any additional findings.",
    "UIC Cons": "- Legislation does not contain gender inclusive language\n- Taskforce members not compensated for their work, but get per diem and mileage\n- Language of policy explicitly states that goals include “studying how to increase state resources for reporting and identifying missing and murdered indigenous women in the state.” With a focus on task force collaboration with tribal law enforcement agencies, the policy risks glossing over the structural and material foundations sustaining the MMIP crisis.",

    "Summary": "*Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signs Executive Order 2021-013 recognizing the MMIWR crisis in New Mexico and beyond as inextricably rooted in the larger, complex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples, the need to improve the working relationships between tribal nations and law enforcement agencies, the critical need for enhanced data to illuminate the crisis, and establishing the New Mexico Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force. This task force is created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents (promulgated 5/5/21).",
    "UIC Pros": "- Powerful language choice is embedded into the policy, with the Executive Order recognizing the MMIWR crisis as inextricably rooted in the larger, “complex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples.” The Order also highlights the complex role New Mexico’s border towns have had in the ongoing MMIP crisis, as well as the way interstates running through reservations contribute to exacerbating the issue.\n- Legislation creates a landmark Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force for New Mexico, created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents\n- Taskforce is of considerable size (40), comprised of professionals, representatives from tribes, and a requirement for representatives who are Indigenous survivors of violence or family members of an Indigenous relative who has been a victim of violence, members of the LGBTQ/2S+ community, and Indigenous youth (although capped at 5 members). Nonetheless, there is still a disproportionate presence of law enforcement on the task force (a drawback for UIC).\n- There are action items that hold the task force accountable, such as the requirement that through the subcommittees, the task force will develop a MMIWR State Response Plan as well as present proposed legislation to the appropriate legislative interim committees and the Governor “as soon as possible.”",

The USAO then plans to work with each Tribe to establish Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRP) in all tribal communities.

The task force will also seek input from representatives from tribal law enforcement and federal agencies to review cold cases involving murdered and missing indigenous women and girls; and address the need for greater clarity concerning roles, authorities, and jurisdiction throughout the lifecycle of cases involving murdered and missing indigenous women and girls.

This Bill mandates that the criminal justice training commission shall collaborate with the two liaisons for missing and murdered indigenous persons pursuant to RCW 43.43.874 to provide training to law enforcement officers and county coroners in tribal sovereignty, customs, culture, traditions, and spirituality, to facilitate compliance with proper conduct in varying situations involving missing or murdered peoples. Further, the Washington state patrol shall establish and maintain a missing children and endangered person clearinghouse which shall include the maintenance and operation of a toll-free telephone hotline and develop and implement a plan, commonly known as an \"amber alert plan\" or an \"endangered missing person advisory plan\"  to enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Lastly the bill calls for the department of commerce's office of crime victims advocacy to award grant funding to establish a pilot project providing wraparound services to indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking as well as grant funding to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking (introduced on 4/5/21-died in committee).",
