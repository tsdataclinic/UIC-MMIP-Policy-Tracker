    "Summary":"This bill creates the Utah Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls Task Force. This Bill mandates conducting consultations with tribal governments on the scope and nature of the issues regarding murdered and missing indigenous women and girls; develop model protocols and procedures to apply to new and unsolved cases of murdered or missing indigenous women and girls, including the best practices for improving the way law enforcement investigators and prosecutors respond to the high volume of the cases, and to the investigative challenges that might be presented in cases involving female victims; practices for collecting and sharing data among various jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies; better use of existing criminal databases. The task force will also seek input from representatives from tribal law enforcement and federal agencies to review cold cases involving murdered and missing indigenous women and girls; and address the need for greater clarity concerning roles, authorities, and jurisdiction throughout the lifecycle of cases involving murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. (passed on 3\/17\/21)",
    "UIC Pros":"+This Bill mandates conducting consultations with tribal governments on the scope and nature of the issues regarding murdered and missing indigenous women and girls, as well as the development of model protocols and procedures to apply to new and unsolved cases of MMIWG\n+ The bill mandates the collection and sharing of data among various jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies with the aims of improving the use of existing criminal databases\n+ Action items such as the requirement for the production of a report including a summary of the task force's findings and recommendations for improvements in the criminal justice and social service systems for preventing and addressing crimes involving murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls in the state\n\n\n",
    "UIC Cons":"- The task force will seek input from representatives from tribal law enforcement and federal agencies to review cold cases involving MMIWG, but the structure of the working group only requires one representative of a Utah Native American tribe. There are no requirements for the inclusion of survivors of families of MMIP.\n- Language in the legislation fails to be gender inclusive, focusing exclusively on women and girls\n- Very limited money dedicated to establishing the taskforce (less than $10K)\n- Education and outreach campaigns are the focus of preventative work carried out by the task force, diverting the structural and material concerns of the MMIP crisis of the necessary attention they need.\n\n\n\n",

The measure directs the OSBI to coordinate with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the U.S. Department of Justice to obtain federal funding to coordinate efforts and gather data to address missing and murdered indigenous person in Oklahoma. Once funds are secured, OSBI is to create an Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons to work with state, tribal and federal law enforcement agencies on missing persons and homicide cases involving American Indian individuals. The liaison is to develop protocols and assist families, tribal agencies and other entities using the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and other resources. The liaison is to facilitate trainings for law enforcement and consult with community organizations that serve indigenous populations to promote community relations and develop best practices.",
    "UIC Cons":"Any individual hired within the Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons is required to have significant experience working with tribal communities but not required to be an Indigenous person. Office members must consult with community organizations that serve indigenous populations to promote community relations and develop best practices but do not need to account for the best interests of Indigenous peoples.

    "Summary":"Defining proper conduct and communication between the county coroner, law enforcement, and indigenous communities in dealing with the remains of missing or murdered indigenous persons. This Bill mandates that the criminal justice training commission shall collaborate with the two liaisons for missing and murdered indigenous persons pursuant to RCW 43.43.874 to provide training to law enforcement officers and county coroners in tribal sovereignty, customs, culture, traditions, and spirituality, to facilitate compliance with proper conduct in varying situations involving missing or murdered peoples. Further, the Washington state patrol shall establish and maintain a missing children and endangered person clearinghouse which shall include the maintenance and operation of a toll-free telephone hotline and develop and implement a plan, commonly known as an \"amber alert plan\" or an \"endangered missing person advisory plan\"  to enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Lastly the bill calls for the department of commerce's office of crime victims advocacy to award grant funding to establish a pilot project providing wraparound services to indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking as well as grant funding to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking (introduced on 4\/5\/21-died in committee).

    "Summary":"Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 107 designates May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California. It addresses the high rates of violence faced by indigenous women, citing that homicide is a leading cause of death and that indigenous women in some tribal communities face murder rates significantly higher than the national average. The resolution highlights the lack of comprehensive data on missing and murdered indigenous people, especially those in urban areas, despite indigenous women comprising about 70 percent of this urban population. It references a study by the Urban Indian Health Institute, noting California's high death rate of indigenous women in urban cities. Finally, it mandates the distribution of the resolution for awareness and action on this critical issue.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation offers several benefits:\n\n1. **Raises Awareness:** By designating May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California, it raises public awareness about the high rates of violence faced by indigenous people, especially women, in both tribal and urban communities.\n\n2. **Acknowledges the Crisis:** The resolution acknowledges the crisis as a significant issue, recognizing the disproportionate rates of violence and homicide against indigenous women and the overarching problem affecting indigenous communities.\n\n3. **Promotes Gender Inclusivity:** The use of gender-inclusive language emphasizes that the crisis affects all indigenous people, expanding the scope of awareness and concern beyond just indigenous women to include men and non-binary indigenous people as well.\n\n4. **Highlights Data Gaps:** It underscores the dearth of comprehensive data on missing and murdered indigenous people, particularly in urban settings, which is a critical step towards understanding the full scope of the issue and working towards solutions.\n\n5. **Encourages Action and Distribution of Information:** The legislation mandates the distribution of the resolution, suggesting that spreading information about this issue is vital for sparking action and involvement from various sections of society to address and mitigate the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation, while beneficial in raising awareness, has notable drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Evaluation Mechanisms:** It does not outline any specific mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of the initiative, such as data collection or consultation processes with affected communities. This omission makes it challenging to measure progress or the impact of the awareness month.\n\n2. **Absence of Direct Input from Indigenous Communities:** There is no mention of direct input or consultation from MMIP survivors, their relatives, or broader Indigenous communities in the drafting of the resolution. This lack of involvement may overlook critical insights and needs of those most affected by the issue.\n\n3. **No Mention of Action Steps Beyond Awareness:** While it mandates the distribution of the resolution for awareness, the legislation lacks a clear outline of specific action steps or policies to directly address and reduce cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Awareness alone may not lead to tangible changes or improvements in the crisis.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"No",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"The legislation provided does not mention any specific mechanisms for evaluation such as a final report, consultation with community, tribal consultation, a Tribal Crisis Response Plan (TCRP), monitoring, or data collection.

Through the MMIP liaison, relatives of MMIP can visit remains and conduct any spiritual practices (as long as it doesn't interfere with an active investigation\/preserving evidence). \"Amber Alert Plan\" or an \"Endangered Missing Person Advisory Plan\" can enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Legislation aims to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking. ",
    "UIC Cons":"Relatives of MMIP cannot conduct any type of ceremony until getting permission from county coroner and lead investigator.

    "Summary":"*Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signs Executive Order 2021-013 recognizing the MMIWR crisis in New Mexico and beyond as inextricably rooted in the larger, complex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples, the need to improve the working relationships between tribal nations and law enforcement agencies, the critical need for enhanced data to illuminate the crisis, and establishing the New Mexico Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force. This task force is created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents (promulgated 5\/5\/21).",
    "UIC Pros":"- Powerful language choice is embedded into the policy, with the Executive Order recognizing the MMIWR crisis as inextricably rooted in the larger, \u201ccomplex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples.\u201d The Order also highlights the complex role New Mexico\u2019s border towns have had in the ongoing MMIP crisis, as well as the way interstates running through reservations contribute to exacerbating the issue.\n- Legislation creates a landmark Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force for New Mexico, created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents\n- Taskforce is of considerable size (40), comprised of professionals, representatives from tribes, and a requirement for representatives who are Indigenous survivors of violence or family members of an Indigenous relative who has been a victim of violence, members of the LGBTQ\/2S+ community, and Indigenous youth (although capped at 5 members). Nonetheless, there is still a disproportionate presence of law enforcement on the task force (a drawback for UIC).\n- There are action items that hold the task force accountable, such as the requirement that through the subcommittees, the task force will develop a MMIWR State Response Plan as well as present proposed legislation to the appropriate legislative interim committees and the Governor \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",

    "Summary":"House Resolution No. 40, introduced by Assembly Member Ramos on April 26, 2021, designates May 2021 as California's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Awareness Month. The resolution addresses the alarming rates of violence against Indigenous women, citing that in 2016, 5,712 cases were reported to the National Crime Information Center, and that in some tribal communities, Indigenous women face murder rates 10 times higher than the national average. It also highlights the lack of comprehensive data on this issue, particularly for Indigenous women in urban areas, despite them constituting about 70 percent of the Native population. Furthermore, it references a report by the Urban Indian Health Institute indicating that California has the sixth highest death rate of Indigenous women in urban cities, and notes California's status as the state with the largest population of American Indians. Finally, the resolution mandates the Chief Clerk of the Assembly to distribute copies of this resolution for appropriate dissemination.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation offers several notable benefits:\n\n1. Raises Awareness: By designating May 2021 as California's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Awareness Month, the legislation raises awareness about the disproportionately high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\n\n2. Highlights a Critical Issue: The resolution brings attention to the alarming statistics related to violence against Indigenous women, such as the report of 5,712 missing and murdered Indigenous cases in 2016 and the heightened murder rates in some tribal communities.\n\n3. Addresses Data Gaps: It draws attention to the lack of comprehensive data on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, especially those in urban areas, acknowledging the need for more thorough data collection and research.\n\n4. Emphasizes California's Role: Given California's status as the state with the largest population of American Indians, the resolution underscores the state's significant role in addressing this crisis and setting a precedent for action.\n\n5. Promotes Appropriate Dissemination: By mandating the distribution of the resolution, it ensures that the information reaches relevant parties, potentially fostering further dialogue and action on this critical issue.\n\nIn sum, the legislation serves as a vital step towards acknowledging and addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in California, aiming to generate broader awareness and prompt much-needed discussion and actions on this issue.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation has several drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Actions or Solutions:** While it raises awareness by designating an awareness month, the resolution lacks specific actions, policies, or solutions directly addressing the issue of violence against Indigenous women and girls. There's no mention of funding, programs, or partnerships aimed at prevention, support, or justice.\n\n2. **No Mention of Evaluation Mechanisms:** It does not outline any mechanisms for evaluation or follow-up, such as data collection, monitoring, or reporting. This omission makes it difficult to measure the resolution's impact or effectiveness in addressing the crisis over time.\n\n3. **Limited Scope:** The legislation specifically focuses on Indigenous women and girls without incorporating gender-inclusive or broader Indigenous community language. This narrow focus could potentially overlook other affected members of the Indigenous community, such as men, boys, and non-binary individuals who are also vulnerable.\n\n4. **Absence of Indigenous Voices:** There is no indication that the resolution's drafting involved consultation with MMIP survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or Indigenous communities in general. The lack of direct involvement or input from those most affected by the issue could result in missed insights and solutions that are culturally informed and community-driven.\n\n5. **Potential for Symbolic Action:** Without outlining concrete steps or commitments beyond awareness, there's a risk that the resolution may be perceived as a symbolic gesture rather than a catalyst for real change.\n\nIn summary, while the resolution spotlights an important issue, its effectiveness is limited by the absence of direct action plans, evaluative mechanisms, inclusive scope, involvement of affected communities, and potential dependence on symbolic significance over tangible impact.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"No",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"The legislation provided does not mention any specific mechanisms for evaluation such as a final report, consultation with community, tribal consultation, a Tribal Crisis Response Plan (TCRP), monitoring, or data collection.

It focuses on designating May 2021 as California\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Awareness Month and transmitting copies for appropriate distribution.

The Senate resolution calls on the U.S. population and interested groups to commemorate the lives of missing and murdered Indigenous women and demonstrate solidarity with the victims' families.",

Further, there is no mention of race and the ways this can enhance the disparate impacts of the missing and murdered crisis. As such, if there is potential to impact urban Indigenous populations in the Chicago area, it will only be by chance. No language stipulating the requirement of cultural relevance of services or approaches. Language is not inclusive of gender diversity. Bill disproportionately centers law enforcement and Chicago bureaucracy, prioritizing knowledge from police and governmental institutions over the lived experiences of indigenous people, failing to center Indigenous voices and perspectives.

    "UIC Pros":"- Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs) will be locally tailored with ample opportunity for tribal input. There is explicit mention of preventive measures, survivor services, and education programs that can be implemented across Alaska to reduce rates of violence against and within Indigenous communities. Formulation of TCRP's utilizes a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, with the structure of these plans centering Indigenous populations, oftentimes left out by legislation on a community level. The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures. With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e - police departments), it is likely that law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before.",
    "UIC Cons":"-The language within disseminated information regarding the TCRP's still appears reactive to MMIP, rather than addressing root causes of ongoing violence.

The committee is mandated to study and propose measures to address violence against indigenous peoples, submitting reports periodically until September 30, 2026. Members won't receive compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses. Funding is allocated through appropriations to the attorney general.",
    "UIC Pros":"Representation and Inclusion: Indigenous people are directly represented in the study committee, both in the house and the senate, ensuring that their voices are heard in discussions about issues affecting them.\nHolistic Approach:The comprehensive study and ongoing reviews address various aspects of violence against indigenous peoples, including missing and murdered individuals, allowing for a holistic understanding of the problem.\n",
    "UIC Cons":"Limited Timeline: The timeline for submitting reports and the repeal of the study committee by September 30, 2026, may be considered relatively short. Critics might argue that a more extended period is necessary to conduct a thorough study and implement effective measures.\nFunding Dependency: The use of appropriated monies may be subject to limitations, and critics may argue that greater financial resources are needed for a more robust and sustained effort.\nPotential for Incomplete Representation: While efforts are made to include indigenous representatives, critics may argue that the selection process might not fully capture the diversity of indigenous communities, potentially leaving some voices unheard.\nLack of Compensation: Committee members not being eligible for compensation might be seen as a drawback, as it could limit the ability of individuals, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, to actively participate.\nFocus on Gender Violence: The emphasis on crimes of gender violence may be viewed as limiting, and critics might argue that a broader focus on all forms of violence against indigenous peoples is necessary.\nUncertain Impact of Proposed Legislation: While the committee has the authority to propose legislation, the actual impact of these proposed measures on addressing the issues of missing and murdered indigenous peoples remains uncertain until implemented and evaluated.\nPotential for Insufficient Cultural Understanding: Despite efforts to ensure cultural accuracy, critics might express concerns that the study committee, composed of individuals who may not fully represent all cultural nuances, may inadvertently overlook certain cultural aspects in their recommendations.\nDependency on Law Enforcement: The reliance on law enforcement for data collection may raise concerns among some indigenous communities, given historical and systemic issues with law enforcement relationships in these communities.

    "Summary":"Michigan's MMIP Pilot Program establishes the first tribal community response plans for missing indigenous persons cases. Michigan is among the first of six pilot-program states developing community response plans, in accordance with the U.S. Attorney General's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Initiative and the President's Operation Lady Justice Task Force. The plans address four core components of a proper response to a missing persons case: law enforcement, victim services, community outreach and public communications. 12 Tribal communities have established response plans to improve handling of emergent MMIP cases by how each branch in the local, state, and national government can work together. ",

    "Summary":"This legislation, SB 211, relates to the Alaska Police Standards Council, the Department of Public Safety, and the duties of the attorney general. It establishes the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons Review Commission and requires a report on investigative resources for cases involving these groups. The bill also includes provisions for training, collaboration, and reporting related to missing and murdered indigenous individuals. It establishes a grant program for Alaska tribes to address issues related to missing and murdered indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons. The legislation also outlines confidentiality rules, meeting procedures, and transition terms for the Review Commission.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation, SB 211, brings attention to the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons by establishing a dedicated Review Commission and requiring reports on investigative resources for these cases. It includes inclusive language recognizing the diversity within Indigenous communities, particularly by acknowledging \"two-spirit\" individuals. The establishment of a grant program for Alaska tribes to address issues related to missing and murdered indigenous individuals is a proactive step towards addressing and preventing these cases. Additionally, the emphasis on collaboration and policy recommendations shows a commitment to reducing instances of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons.",
    "UIC Cons":"Based on the provided information and categories, it appears that one potential drawback of the legislation could be the lack of a specific task force dedicated to addressing the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP). While the establishment of the Review Commission is a positive step, a dedicated task force could provide additional focused resources and attention to this important issue. Additionally, the legislation may have limitations in addressing the needs and input from MMIP relatives specifically, as it does not explicitly mention a direct focus on their involvement in the decision-making processes. This lack of specific emphasis on direct input from MMIP relatives could be seen as a potential limitation in ensuring their voices and perspectives are fully represented in the implementation of the legislation.",

    "Summary":"This legislation designates May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California. It highlights the alarming rates of missing and murdered indigenous cases reported and acknowledges the particularly high murder rates faced by indigenous women in tribal communities. The resolution points out the lack of comprehensive data on this issue, especially concerning indigenous people in urban areas. It references a 2018 report by the Urban Indian Health Institute, noting significant findings about the demographics of the victims in urban cities, including California's ranking with the sixth highest death rate of indigenous women. Finally, it calls for the distribution of this resolution for appropriate awareness and action.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation for Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California offers several benefits:\n\n1. **Raises Awareness:** It designates May 2022 as a specific month to focus public attention on the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people, thereby increasing public awareness and understanding of an often-overlooked issue.\n\n2. **Acknowledges a Critical Issue:** This resolution acknowledges the high rates of violence faced by indigenous people, particularly women in tribal communities, and the lack of comprehensive data on the broader crisis, especially in urban areas.\n\n3. **Promotes Gender Inclusivity:** By using the term \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous People,\" the legislation adopts gender-inclusive language, recognizing that the issue transcends gender and affects the wider indigenous community.\n\n4. **Highlights the Need for Better Data:** By referencing specific reports and statistics, it underscores the critical need for improved data collection and analysis to understand the scope of the issue fully and mobilize resources effectively.\n\n5. **Calls for Action:** Though it mainly serves to raise awareness, the legislation implicitly calls for further action by highlighting the significance of the problem and distributing the resolution for appropriate awareness and response, paving the way for future measures to address the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation, while beneficial in raising awareness and acknowledgment of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People (MMIP), presents certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Mechanisms for Evaluation**: The absence of specified mechanisms for ongoing evaluation, such as data monitoring or a final report, means there is no structured way to assess the effectiveness of the awareness month or the progress made toward addressing the issues it highlights.\n\n2. **No Direct Action or Policy Change**: The legislation focuses on designation and awareness without mandating specific actions, initiatives, or policy changes aimed at directly combating the problem or supporting MMIP survivors and their families.\n\n3. **Limited Involvement from Impacted Communities**: There is no indication of consultation with or input from MMIP survivors, their relatives, or Indigenous communities in the drafting of the legislation. This omission could mean missed opportunities for incorporating valuable insights and ensuring the measures fully address the communities' needs and perspectives.\n\nThese drawbacks highlight areas where the legislation, despite its contributions to raising awareness, may fall short in enacting substantial change or directly addressing the root causes and consequences of the MMIP crisis.",

This collaboration emphasized within the legislation between the two MMIP liaisons, law enforcement officers, and county coroner's signals enhanced respect for tribes and their relationship with their deceased. Through the MMIP liaison, relatives of MMIP can visit remains and conduct any spiritual practices (as long as it doesn't interfere with an active investigation\/preserving evidence). \"Amber Alert Plan\" or an \"Endangered Missing Person Advisory Plan\" can enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons.

In this way there is encouraging attention paid to prevention. ",
    "UIC Cons":"- The legislation lacks a structure that calls for the inclusion or centering of survivors or relatives of MMIP on the task force. The bill generally fails to amplify voices from the Indigenous community.\n- Legislative language alludes that recommendations will be made to federally recognized tribes in the state to reduce cases of missing and murdered indigenous persons, however this serves to obscure the structural conditions facilitating and motivating the ongoing MMIP crisis, even suggesting that tribal communities are, themselves, to blame for the violence waged against their Indigenous populations.   \n- May preclude authentic Indigenous representation because task force members must be appointed by Attorney General, in this way the legislation falls short in centering the voices of survivors and relatives",

VAWA 2013 did not apply to Alaska Native villages with the exception of two tribes, so allowing Alaska Native villages to be covered by the proposed legislation was a critical change. Changed from VAWA 2018 is the name \"Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ),\" which is now proposed as \"Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction,\" thus providing a clarification as to who these provisions are for (tribal communities). New VAWA legislation respond to concerns raised by the National Congress of American Indians, as well as other community members regarding the number of tribes that can implement SDVCJ because of the costs of meeting congressionally delegated standards. The new version of VAWA proposes the allocation of money to tribal communities. This bill has expanded tribal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous offenders for crimes which were not previously included in the SDVCJ of the 2013 reauthorization. These include trafficking, child abuse, child witness of abuse, stalking, sexual assault, elder abuse, and assault against law enforcement.",

    "Summary":"NJ SR88- Recognizes the disproportionate violence within tribal lands, in indigenous villages, and within urban communities resulting in an epidemic of missing or murdered Native American women and girls, as well as the underreporting of this phenomenon and the failure of federal legislation thus far to prevent violence towards Native American women and girls and, as such urging the US Department of Justice to dedicate additional resources to solving cases involving missing or murdered Native American women and girls (pending for 2021, introduced 9\/24\/20)",
    "UIC Pros":"- Recognizes Tribal sovereignty within the language of the policy (\u201cThe unique position of Native American tribes as both sovereign and dependent creates problematic jurisdictional barriers that sometimes prohibit effective criminal justice responses from both federal and local authorities).",
    "UIC Cons":"- Language in this legislation fails to be gender inclusive, only mentioning women and girls\n- Shifts onus onto the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for the alleviation of the MMIP crisis, but there is much New Jersey is capable of in terms of combating violence against Native communities.",

    "Summary":"Concerning responding to the missing indigenous persons crisis, and, in connection therewith, establishing the office of liaison for missing and murdered indigenous relatives and making an appropriation.",
    "UIC Pros":"The bill demonstrates a commitment to addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous persons by establishing the Office of Liaison, signaling increased awareness and attention to the issue. This dedicated office provides specialized support for investigations and cases involving Indigenous victims, promoting culturally sensitive approaches. The legislation actively involves the community through a Community Volunteer Advisory Board, ensuring Indigenous-led organizations contribute to addressing the problem. Emphasizing collaboration with various stakeholders, including law enforcement, tribes, and Indigenous-led organizations, the bill aims to overcome jurisdictional barriers. Mandating training for peace officers and creating a clearinghouse database, the legislation seeks to improve responses and facilitate efficient investigations, while promoting a trauma-informed and victim-centered approach to address the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"\nQuestions may arise about who qualifies as indigenous and whether the legislation effectively encompasses all relevant cases. Some may argue that enhancing existing agencies might be more prudent than creating new structures like an office and advisory board. Privacy concerns include the legislation granting access to sensitive records, concerns for the potential misuse of confidential data. Mandated training for peace officers might face skepticism regarding its practicality, effectiveness, and associated costs. Additionally, coordination challenges in collaborating with tribal governments, federal agencies, and law enforcement may be questioned for feasibility and effectiveness, especially in cases involving jurisdictional conflicts or conflicting interests. Skepticism may extend to the long-term sustainability of proposed initiatives, with critics questioning whether adequate funding will be sustained over time. The legislation lacks clear enforcement mechanisms or consequences for non-compliance, potentially diminishing its effectiveness. Lastly, the frequency and content of reports may be insufficient or not comprehensive enough to address the complexities of the issue.",

The Pilot Project, in accordance with the Justice Department\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP) Initiative, and in furtherance of and Savanna\u2019s Act, implements tailored Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRP) in select pilot sites across Alaska.

    "UIC Pros":"- Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs) will be locally tailored, with ample opportunity for tribal input\n- Explicit mention of preventative measures, survivor services, and educational programs that can be implemented across Alaska to reduce rates of violence against and within Indigenous communities\n- Formulation of TCRP\u2019s utilizes a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, with the structure of these plans centering Indigenous populations, oftentimes left out by legislation, on a community level. \n- The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures\n- With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e. police departments), it is likely law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before.",
    "UIC Cons":"- The language within disseminated information regarding the TCRP\u2019s still appears reactive to MMIP, rather than addressing root causes of ongoing violence. \n- The heavy policy emphasis on collaboration with law enforcement may limit the kinds of \"justice\" that can come from these community response plans. \n",
