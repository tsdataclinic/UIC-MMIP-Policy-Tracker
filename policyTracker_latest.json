    "Summary":"Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 107 designates May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California. It addresses the high rates of violence faced by indigenous women, citing that homicide is a leading cause of death and that indigenous women in some tribal communities face murder rates significantly higher than the national average. The resolution highlights the lack of comprehensive data on missing and murdered indigenous people, especially those in urban areas, despite indigenous women comprising about 70 percent of this urban population. It references a study by the Urban Indian Health Institute, noting California's high death rate of indigenous women in urban cities. Finally, it mandates the distribution of the resolution for awareness and action on this critical issue.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation offers several benefits:\n\n1. **Raises Awareness:** By designating May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California, it raises public awareness about the high rates of violence faced by indigenous people, especially women, in both tribal and urban communities.\n\n2. **Acknowledges the Crisis:** The resolution acknowledges the crisis as a significant issue, recognizing the disproportionate rates of violence and homicide against indigenous women and the overarching problem affecting indigenous communities.\n\n3. **Promotes Gender Inclusivity:** The use of gender-inclusive language emphasizes that the crisis affects all indigenous people, expanding the scope of awareness and concern beyond just indigenous women to include men and non-binary indigenous people as well.\n\n4. **Highlights Data Gaps:** It underscores the dearth of comprehensive data on missing and murdered indigenous people, particularly in urban settings, which is a critical step towards understanding the full scope of the issue and working towards solutions.\n\n5. **Encourages Action and Distribution of Information:** The legislation mandates the distribution of the resolution, suggesting that spreading information about this issue is vital for sparking action and involvement from various sections of society to address and mitigate the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation, while beneficial in raising awareness, has notable drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Evaluation Mechanisms:** It does not outline any specific mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of the initiative, such as data collection or consultation processes with affected communities. This omission makes it challenging to measure progress or the impact of the awareness month.\n\n2. **Absence of Direct Input from Indigenous Communities:** There is no mention of direct input or consultation from MMIP survivors, their relatives, or broader Indigenous communities in the drafting of the resolution. This lack of involvement may overlook critical insights and needs of those most affected by the issue.\n\n3. **No Mention of Action Steps Beyond Awareness:** While it mandates the distribution of the resolution for awareness, the legislation lacks a clear outline of specific action steps or policies to directly address and reduce cases of missing and murdered Indigenous people. Awareness alone may not lead to tangible changes or improvements in the crisis.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"No",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"The legislation provided does not mention any specific mechanisms for evaluation such as a final report, consultation with community, tribal consultation, a Tribal Crisis Response Plan (TCRP), monitoring, or data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a quote or a numbered list of such mechanisms from the cited legislation.",
    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"Yes, the legislation uses gender inclusive language by referring to the broader category of \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous People\" rather than focusing exclusively on women. This can be seen in the title \"Relative to Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month.\" It acknowledges the crisis affecting all indigenous people, not just women, expanding the scope to be more inclusive.",
    "Prevention Efforts?":"No",
    "Prevention Efforts":"No.",
    "Level of Survivor \/ Relative Input":"No",
    "Centering of Indigenous Voices":"No.\n\nThe legislation text does not explicitly mention any input or consultation from MMIP (Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples) survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or Indigenous communities in the creation or formulation of the resolution. It primarily focuses on designating May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California and states statistical data and findings related to the issue. There is no section within the provided text that indicates a direct involvement or contribution from these groups in drafting the resolution.",

    "Summary":"Senate Bill 230, known as \"Ida's Law,\" directs the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to collaborate with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Department of Justice to address the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous persons in Oklahoma. The bill mandates the Bureau to seek federal funding to establish an Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons, which will include a missing persons specialist if funding permits. This Office will work with various law enforcement agencies, develop best practices for handling missing persons cases involving American Indian individuals, and assist in using resources like the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). It also involves coordinating with state offices and facilitating training on issues relating to missing and murdered Indigenous persons. The legislation is set to be effective from November 1, 2021.\n",
    "UIC Pros":"The previously mentioned legislation, Senate Bill 230 known as \"Ida's Law,\" offers several benefits:\n\n1. **Enhanced Collaboration**: It fosters better coordination between the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation and federal authorities such as the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Department of Justice. This collaboration aims to improve efforts in addressing missing and murdered Indigenous persons in Oklahoma.\n\n2. **Establishment of a Specialized Office**: It mandates the creation of the Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons. This office, contingent on federal funding, will include a missing persons specialist, enhancing focused support for these cases.\n\n3. **Development of Best Practices**: The legislation directs the development of best practices for law enforcement in handling cases involving American Indian individuals. This is aimed at improving the overall response to such cases and could lead to more efficient and sensitive handling of these critical situations.\n\n4. **Training and Awareness**: The bill includes provisions to facilitate trainings for law enforcement and public members on issues related to missing and murdered Indigenous persons, which can increase awareness and improve investigative responses.\n\n5. **Support for Families**: It assists families and tribal agencies in utilizing resources like the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), aiding in the navigation of complex legal and governmental landscapes.\n\n6. **Gender-Inclusive Approach**: The use of gender-neutral language ensures that the law inclusively addresses all missing and murdered Indigenous persons, promoting fairness and equality.\n\nThese components collectively aim to enhance the effectiveness of investigations and interventions related to missing and murdered Indigenous persons in Oklahoma, potentially leading to better outcomes for these communities.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation related to Senate Bill 230, or \"Ida's Law,\" has several drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Explicit Indigenous Involvement**: Although the bill mandates the creation of an Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons, it does not specify involvement or consultation with Indigenous communities, MMIP survivors, or their relatives in the drafting or operational phases. This might lead to oversight or gaps in addressing the specific needs and cultural considerations of these communities.\n\n2. **Dependency on Federal Funding**: The effectiveness of the Office is highly contingent on obtaining federal funding. This dependency could potentially delay or limit the implementation of critical initiatives if sufficient funding is not secured.\n\n3. **Absence of Evaluative Mechanisms**: There is no mention of specific mechanisms such as reporting, monitoring, or data collection for assessing the effectiveness of the implemented measures. Without these, it is challenging to measure the impact of the legislation and make necessary adjustments or improvements.\n\n4. **Limited Scope**: While the bill aims to establish protocols and assist with using resources like the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), it may not fully address broader systemic issues contributing to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous persons, such as socio-economic factors and jurisdictional challenges.\n\nThese limitations could hinder the overall impact of the legislation in combating the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous persons comprehensively and effectively.",

The Act also addresses establishing and maintaining a missing children and endangered clearinghouse. Also calls for the Department of Commerce's office of crime victims advocacy to award grant funding for services to indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking as well as to increase visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are victims of trafficking.",
    "UIC Pros":"The Bill does not only focus on the far\/murder end of the crisis concerning violence against Indigenous people with the MMIP crisis, but also includes language focused on Indigenous survivors of human trafficking. This collaboration emphasized within the legislation between the two MMIP liaisons, law enforcement officers, and county coroner's signals enhanced respect for tribes and their relationship with their deceased. Through the MMIP liaison, relatives of MMIP can visit remains and conduct any spiritual practices (as long as it doesn't interfere with an active investigation\/preserving evidence). \"Amber Alert Plan\" or an \"Endangered Missing Person Advisory Plan\" can enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Legislation aims to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking. ",
    "UIC Cons":"Relatives of MMIP cannot conduct any type of ceremony until getting permission from county coroner and lead investigator. The legislation is focused on proper conduct and systematized response once an Indigenous person has already gone missing, with emphasis on roles and cooperation of coroners and law enforcement.

    "Summary":"Substitute House Bill 1725, enacted by the State of Washington in 2022, aims to address the high rates of violence and disappearance among indigenous persons by establishing a specific \"missing indigenous person alert\" within the state's endangered person advisory system. The legislation expands the existing framework of the Washington State Patrol's missing persons clearinghouse, which collaborates with various local and national entities to distribute crucial information and facilitate the recovery of missing persons. This bill introduces tools for more effective public engagement and leverages media, both traditional and social, to enhance visibility and support for cases involving missing indigenous people. The \"missing indigenous person alert\" operates alongside other designations such as the \"silver alert\" for elderly missing endangered persons, defining specific criteria for activating these alerts based on age, disability, and other vulnerabilities. The initiative reflects a collaborative effort among lawmakers, tribal leaders, and community activists to prioritize and address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons.",
    "UIC Pros":"The Substitute House Bill 1725 presents several significant benefits in addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons:\n\n1. **Enhanced Alert System**: By establishing the \"missing indigenous person alert,\" the legislation directly targets the high rates of disappearances among indigenous communities, providing a dedicated mechanism within the state's advisory alert system to facilitate prompt and effective responses.\n\n2. **Broad Inclusion and Public Engagement**: The legislation employs gender-inclusive language, acknowledging and addressing the needs of all indigenous persons regardless of gender. This inclusivity ensures a more comprehensive approach to the issue and supports the inclusive engagement of the community in these efforts.\n\n3. **Collaborative Framework**: The bill fosters collaboration between tribal, local, state, and federal agencies, enhancing the coordination and sharing of critical information through existing networks like the Washington State Patrol's missing persons clearinghouse. This coordination is crucial for leveraging wider resources and expertise in locating missing persons.\n\n4. **Media Utilization and Community Involvement**: It leverages both traditional and social media to raise public awareness and encourage community participation in tracking and reporting the whereabouts of missing indigenous persons. This approach helps to maximize visibility and community-based support, which is vital for the success of recovery efforts.\n\n5. **Representation and Advocacy**: Featuring active involvement from indigenous politicians such as Representative Debra Lekanoff, the legislation is shaped by those with direct insight into the needs and challenges of indigenous communities, ensuring that the strategies and solutions are culturally informed and effectively targeted.\n\nOverall, these benefits demonstrate the bill's comprehensive strategy to tackle the ongoing crisis by enhancing existing systems and fostering essential collaborations, making it a robust legislative effort to protect indigenous communities.\n",
    "UIC Cons":"While Substitute House Bill 1725 offers significant strides in addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons, several drawbacks or limitations can be identified from the legislation:\n\n1. **Lack of Evaluation Mechanisms**: The legislation does not specify any mechanisms for evaluating the effectiveness of the new \"missing indigenous person alert\" system or other measures introduced. Without mechanisms such as data collection, monitoring, or comprehensive reports, it becomes difficult to assess impact, identify areas for improvement, or ensure transparency and accountability.\n\n2. **Potential Resource Constraints**: While the bill mandates the expansion and enhancement of alert systems, it mentions that these efforts are to be made \"within existing resources.\" This could imply potential limitations due to budgetary constraints, possibly affecting the robustness or reach of the initiatives, especially in long-term sustainability.\n\n3. **Limited Scope of Impact**: The focus is primarily on enhancing alert systems and cooperation among law enforcement and public agencies, which, while critical, does not address other systemic issues related to the crisis. There's a possible gap in addressing broader social, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to the high rates of violence and disappearance among indigenous people.\n\n4. **Exclusivity in Participation**: Although the involvement of Indigenous representatives and community leaders is highlighted, the legislation does not explicitly detail how wider community participation, particularly from MMIP survivors or their families, is incorporated into the policymaking or ongoing management processes. This might limit the scope of perspectives and insights that are crucial for holistic and effective solutions.\n\n5. **Dependency on Public and Media Cooperation**: The effectiveness of the alert systems heavily relies on public participation and media coverage, which can be variable and influenced by numerous external factors. This dependence could result in inconsistent results in different cases or regions, impacting the overall success of the initiative.\n\nThese limitations suggest that while the legislation is a forward step, there may be areas where further enhancements could strengthen its effectiveness and inclusivity.",

    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"Yes, the legislation uses gender-inclusive language by referring to \"missing indigenous persons\" rather than specifying a particular gender. It accommodates a broader scope than just women by defining \"missing endangered person\" to include any \"missing indigenous woman or indigenous person\".

    "Summary":"The legislation, HB 36, establishes the Missing Persons Response Team Training Grant Program, which is administered by the Department of Justice in Montana. It provides funding for training community-based, multiagency and multijurisdictional missing persons response teams, covering expenses such as licensing, facilitator fees, and travel costs. The newly created Missing Persons Response Team Training Grant Account, funded initially by a transfer of $61,000 from the state general fund, will manage these funds, allowing for up to 10% to be used for administrative costs. Reports on the grant\u2019s distribution are required to be made to the State-Tribal Relations Committee. Additionally, the legislation mandates notification of the act to each federally recognized tribal government in Montana and specifies an effective date of July 1, 2021.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation offers several significant benefits:\n\n1. **Enhanced Training and Preparedness**: By establishing the Missing Persons Response Team Training Grant Program, it facilitates improved training opportunities for community-based, multiagency, and multijurisdictional teams. This is essential for enhancing the effectiveness and coordination of efforts in responding to cases of missing persons.\n\n2. **Financial Support**: The creation of the Missing Persons Response Team Training Grant Account, with an initial funding of $61,000 from the state general fund, ensures there is dedicated financial support to manage the costs associated with such important training, including licensing fees, facilitator honorariums, and travel expenses.\n\n3. **Ongoing Oversight and Accountability**: The requirement for the Department of Justice to report to the State-Tribal Relations Committee ensures transparency and accountability in how the grants are distributed and utilized, promoting continuous improvement in the program. \n\n4. **Inclusion and Sensitivity to Indigenous Communities**: The act requires notification to federally recognized tribal governments in Montana, acknowledging the disproportionate impact of missing persons cases in Indigenous communities and ensuring their inclusion in the dialogue and solutions.\n\n5. **Legislative Support from Indigenous Leadership**: Introduced by Rep Sharon Stewart-Peregoy, an Indigenous politician, the legislation has direct involvement from representatives who are likely to have a deep understanding of the community-specific issues related to missing persons, particularly in Indigenous communities.\n\nThese benefits promise a more structured, inclusive, and effective approach to addressing the issue of missing persons within Montana, with a particular emphasis on collaboration and comprehensive training.\n",
    "UIC Cons":"While the legislation carries several strengths, there are potential drawbacks to consider:\n\n1. **Limited Funding**: The initial allocation of $61,000 might be inadequate for widespread and significant impact across the state, especially when considering the breadth of training and the inclusion of multiple agencies and jurisdictions. This limitation might restrict the number of teams that can be effectively trained or the depth of the training provided.\n\n2. **Administrative Overhead**: Allowing up to 10% of the funds to be used for administrative purposes might dilute the available resources for actual training activities. Administrative costs, if not monitored closely, could consume a significant portion of the funds that could otherwise directly contribute to program objectives.\n\n3. **Potential for Inadequate Evaluation**: The legislation requires reporting to the State-Tribal Relations Committee, but it lacks detailed mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the program's effectiveness over time. This could lead to challenges in assessing whether the training is meeting the needs of the missing persons response teams and adapting strategies accordingly.\n\n4. **Narrow Scope**: The focus on training, while crucial, doesn't address other systemic issues related to missing persons cases, such as prevention strategies, broader community engagement outside of training contexts, or support for the families of missing persons.\n\n5. **Dependence on Continuous Funding**: The sustainability of the training program depends on continuous allocation of funds, which might be subject to political changes and budget constraints. This could impact the long-term viability of the training initiatives.\n\nThese potential limitations highlight areas where additional consideration and planning might be needed to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of the Missing Persons Response Team Training Grant Program.",

    "Summary":"House Resolution No. 40, introduced by Assembly Member Ramos on April 26, 2021, designates May 2021 as California's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Awareness Month. The resolution addresses the alarming rates of violence against Indigenous women, citing that in 2016, 5,712 cases were reported to the National Crime Information Center, and that in some tribal communities, Indigenous women face murder rates 10 times higher than the national average. It also highlights the lack of comprehensive data on this issue, particularly for Indigenous women in urban areas, despite them constituting about 70 percent of the Native population. Furthermore, it references a report by the Urban Indian Health Institute indicating that California has the sixth highest death rate of Indigenous women in urban cities, and notes California's status as the state with the largest population of American Indians. Finally, the resolution mandates the Chief Clerk of the Assembly to distribute copies of this resolution for appropriate dissemination.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation offers several notable benefits:\n\n1. Raises Awareness: By designating May 2021 as California's Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Awareness Month, the legislation raises awareness about the disproportionately high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls.\n\n2. Highlights a Critical Issue: The resolution brings attention to the alarming statistics related to violence against Indigenous women, such as the report of 5,712 missing and murdered Indigenous cases in 2016 and the heightened murder rates in some tribal communities.\n\n3. Addresses Data Gaps: It draws attention to the lack of comprehensive data on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, especially those in urban areas, acknowledging the need for more thorough data collection and research.\n\n4. Emphasizes California's Role: Given California's status as the state with the largest population of American Indians, the resolution underscores the state's significant role in addressing this crisis and setting a precedent for action.\n\n5. Promotes Appropriate Dissemination: By mandating the distribution of the resolution, it ensures that the information reaches relevant parties, potentially fostering further dialogue and action on this critical issue.\n\nIn sum, the legislation serves as a vital step towards acknowledging and addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in California, aiming to generate broader awareness and prompt much-needed discussion and actions on this issue.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation has several drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Actions or Solutions:** While it raises awareness by designating an awareness month, the resolution lacks specific actions, policies, or solutions directly addressing the issue of violence against Indigenous women and girls. There's no mention of funding, programs, or partnerships aimed at prevention, support, or justice.\n\n2. **No Mention of Evaluation Mechanisms:** It does not outline any mechanisms for evaluation or follow-up, such as data collection, monitoring, or reporting. This omission makes it difficult to measure the resolution's impact or effectiveness in addressing the crisis over time.\n\n3. **Limited Scope:** The legislation specifically focuses on Indigenous women and girls without incorporating gender-inclusive or broader Indigenous community language. This narrow focus could potentially overlook other affected members of the Indigenous community, such as men, boys, and non-binary individuals who are also vulnerable.\n\n4. **Absence of Indigenous Voices:** There is no indication that the resolution's drafting involved consultation with MMIP survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or Indigenous communities in general. The lack of direct involvement or input from those most affected by the issue could result in missed insights and solutions that are culturally informed and community-driven.\n\n5. **Potential for Symbolic Action:** Without outlining concrete steps or commitments beyond awareness, there's a risk that the resolution may be perceived as a symbolic gesture rather than a catalyst for real change.\n\nIn summary, while the resolution spotlights an important issue, its effectiveness is limited by the absence of direct action plans, evaluative mechanisms, inclusive scope, involvement of affected communities, and potential dependence on symbolic significance over tangible impact.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"No",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"The legislation provided does not mention any specific mechanisms for evaluation such as a final report, consultation with community, tribal consultation, a Tribal Crisis Response Plan (TCRP), monitoring, or data collection. Therefore, I cannot quote any portion of the legislation regarding mechanisms for evaluation as was requested.",
    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"No",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"No, the legislation specifically focuses on \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls\" and does not use gender-neutral language or expand its scope to refer to missing Indigenous people in general. It consistently refers to women and girls, indicating a specific focus on these genders without including gender-neutral terms or addressing the crisis among Indigenous people more broadly. This approach is evident through the resolution's title and the specific mentions within the text.",
    "Prevention Efforts?":"No",
    "Prevention Efforts":"No.",
    "Level of Survivor \/ Relative Input":"No",
    "Centering of Indigenous Voices":"No.\n\nThe legislation mentions statistics and general issues related to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG) but does not explicitly mention or indicate any direct involvement, consultation, or input from MMIP survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or Indigenous communities in the drafting or introduction of the resolution. It focuses on designating May 2021 as California\u2019s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Awareness Month and transmitting copies for appropriate distribution. The text lacks any specific references to collaboration or consultation processes with affected communities or individuals.",

    "Summary":"The legislation establishes a 15-member task force in New Jersey to address the issue of missing women and girls who are Black, Indigenous, or people of color (BIPOC). The task force is charged with developing policy recommendations, training and education materials, strategies for data collection, and a State-wide public awareness campaign. Members will include key state officials and appointees from legislative leaders and the governor. The task force will report its findings and recommendations to the Governor and Legislature within 18 months. The act will take effect immediately and expire 60 days after the task force's report submission.",
    "UIC Pros":"1. Focused Attention: The creation of a 15-member task force will ensure focused attention on the issue of missing BIPOC women and girls, addressing a critical and often overlooked crisis.\n2. Comprehensive Strategy: By developing policy recommendations, training and education materials, and strategies for data collection, the task force aims to provide a comprehensive approach to tackling the problem.\n3. Community Inclusion: The inclusion of appointed members who are representative of the affected communities ensures that the voices of those impacted are considered in the task force's efforts.\n4. Public Awareness: The legislation mandates a State-wide public awareness campaign, which can help to bring more attention to the issue and potentially prevent future cases.\n5. Legislative Proposals: The requirement for a final report with findings and legislative proposals ensures that the task force's work can translate into concrete policies and actions.\n6. Immediate Action: The act takes effect immediately, signifying urgent action on the issue, with a clear timeline for the task force's objectives and report submission.",
    "UIC Cons":"1. Lack of Inclusivity: The focus on missing women and girls excludes other genders, which limits the scope and effectiveness of the efforts to address missing and murdered Indigenous persons in general.\n2. Representation: While the task force is supposed to include members from impacted communities, there is no explicit requirement for direct input from MMIP survivors, their relatives, Indigenous politicians, or other specific stakeholders.\n3. No Indigenous Sponsorship: The absence of Indigenous sponsors for the legislation may impact its credibility and acceptance within Indigenous communities, reducing its potential impact.\n4. Short Lifespan: The task force is temporary, and the act will expire 60 days after its final report, which may hinder the implementation of long-term solutions.",

    "Summary":"The legislation SB 4 extends the existence of the Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force in Montana beyond its original termination date, now set to terminate on June 30, 2023. The task force is responsible for identifying causes contributing to the issues of missing and murdered indigenous persons and developing strategies to improve communication and cooperation across different jurisdictions to address these issues effectively. It includes a diverse group of members such as representatives from tribal governments and the Montana highway patrol, and it is administratively supported by the Department of Justice. The task force is required to prepare and submit a report of its findings and recommendations before each regular legislative session. The act was effective immediately upon passage and approval.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation surrounding SB 4 offers several significant benefits, including:\n\n1. **Continued Operation and Extended Impact**: By extending the termination date for the Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force, the legislation ensures ongoing efforts to address the critical issue of missing and murdered indigenous persons. This continued focus is crucial for developing long-term solutions and strategies.\n\n2. **Diverse and Inclusive Membership**: The inclusion of representatives from diverse groups such as tribal governments, the Montana Highway Patrol, and Department of Justice ensures varied perspectives and expertise in tackling the issues. This diversity helps in formulating effective interventions that are culturally sensitive and broadly informed.\n\n3. **Strategic Interagency Collaboration**: The task force\u2019s responsibility to enhance communication and cooperation among federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement creates a more unified and efficient approach towards addressing the systemic issues related to indigenous disappearances and murders.\n\n4. **Systematic Data Collection and Reporting**: The requirement for the task force to gather data, monitor developments, and report findings ensures accountability and provides a structured method to measure progress while identifying ongoing challenges.\n\n5. **Community and Tribal Consultation**: Regular meetings with Tribal governments and community organizations ensure that the voices and concerns of those directly impacted are heard and considered in policy-making processes. This consultation is essential for ensuring that actions taken are aligned with the community needs and are more likely to be effective.\n\n6. **Gender-Inclusive Approach**: The use of gender-neutral language in addressing the issue broadens the impact of the task force, recognizing that indigenous persons of all genders are affected by this crisis. This inclusivity ensures that no group is overlooked in the efforts to find solutions.\n\nThese elements collectively enhance the legislation\u2019s ability to bring about meaningful changes and improvements in the management and resolution of missing and murdered indigenous persons cases, acknowledging and addressing an important human rights issue within the state.",
    "UIC Cons":"While the legislation SB 4 possesses many strengths, there are potential drawbacks that might be considered:\n\n1. **Lack of Specificity in Prevention Measures**: The legislation primarily focuses on the identification of causes and improvement of communication and collaboration, without explicitly detailing specific preventive measures or interventions that could directly reduce the rates of missing and murdered indigenous persons.\n\n2. **Limited Visibility of Survivors' Input**: There is no explicit mention of direct involvement or input from MMIP survivors or their families in the task force's activity. This could limit the depth of contextual understanding and emotional insights that could be crucial in shaping effective solutions.\n\n3. **Potential Overlaps and Redundancies**: With multiple agencies involved, there is a potential risk for overlaps or redundancies in efforts, which can lead to inefficiencies unless well-coordinated.\n\n4. **Short Extension Period**: The extension until 2023 might not be sufficient for the task force to see the fruition of long-term strategies or to assess the impact of their interventions over an extended period which is often necessary for systemic issues involving social and justice reforms.\n\n5. **Funding and Resource Allocation**: The legislation does not specify funding sources for continued operations and actions recommended by the task force. This could pose challenges in the implementation of strategies and sustainment of efforts over time if not addressed.\n\nThese aspects could limit the effectiveness of the bill in achieving its intended impact on reducing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons unless appropriately managed or further supplemented by additional measures.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"Yes",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"1. **Final Report**: \"The task force shall, in accordance with 5-11-210, prepare a written report of findings and recommendations for submission to the state-tribal relations interim committee provided for in 5-5-229, no later than September 1, 2020.\"\n\n2. **Consultation with Community and Tribal Consultation**: \"The task force shall convene at least one meeting with tribal and local law enforcement agencies, federally recognized tribes, and urban Indian organizations for the purposes of subsection (3)(b) and to determine the scope of the problem of missing indigenous women and children.\"",
    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"The legislation uses gender-inclusive language by referring to \"missing indigenous persons\" and \"missing and murdered indigenous persons,\" rather than specifying a gender.

    "UIC Pros":"Legislation highlights important factors leading to the exacerbation of the ongoing MMIP crisis, such as the phenomena of \u201cman camps,\u201d and seeks to find ways in which these encampments can be most effectively policed and monitored. This language is critical, as \u201cman camps\u201d are especially prevalent in states with economies dominated by resource extraction like Louisiana. Stipulates action items such as quarterly reports (but only for legislation period of 2 yrs) and provides for pursuit of prevention measures. Legislation calls for cultural competency within sexual violence trainings. ",
    "UIC Cons":"Structure of the task force calls for tribal representatives, but fails to center survivors or relatives of the MMIP crisis.

    "Summary":"The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force launched in July 2020 in partnership with Wisconsin Department of Justice and Indigenous communities to address and prevent future cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Wisconsin. The task force is charged with helping fight the abduction, homicide, violence and trafficking of Indigenous women in Wisconsin and plans to focus on examining the factors that contribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) and the response from social service organizations, understanding the roles federal, state and tribal jurisdictions play, and improving and implementing robust data collection and reporting methods.",
    "UIC Pros":"Office of Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul allocated $300,000 through grants from the federal Victims of Crime Act toward the Wisconsin MMIW Task Force to hire a coordinator and a data analysis contractor.  Out of the $300,000 received from the U.S. Department of Justice's Violence Against Women Act grant program, there is $200,000 being dedicated to a research project to understand how many Native women in the state suffer these crimes.

    "Summary":"The proposed legislation, known as Ida's Law, seeks to address the issue of missing and murdered indigenous persons in Oklahoma by establishing an Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons within the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. This office will coordinate with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Department of Justice to secure federal funding and develop protocols for handling cases involving American Indian individuals. The office will be tasked with supporting families and law enforcement agencies by providing resources, guidance, and training related to missing and murdered indigenous persons. Key components of the office include hiring specialists with experience in working with tribal communities and facilitating collaboration among various state and tribal entities. The legislation is set for activation on November 1, 2021, and emphasizes inter-agency cooperation and community engagement to address this critical issue.",
    "UIC Pros":"The previously mentioned legislation, Ida's Law, presents several benefits geared toward addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons in Oklahoma:\n\n1. **Enhanced Coordination**: By establishing an Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons within the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, the legislation fosters improved coordination between state, federal, and tribal law enforcement. This coordination is crucial for streamlining efforts and improving responses to such cases.\n\n2. **Federal and Community Engagement**: The legislation mandates securing federal funding and actively engaging with community organizations. This dual approach ensures that the initiative has the necessary financial backing while grounding its strategies in community-based insights and support.\n\n3. **Specialized Expertise**: By requiring the hiring of specialists with experience in working with tribal communities, the law ensures that the Office of Liaison is equipped with professionals who understand the unique dynamics and needs of indigenous communities. \n\n4. **Comprehensive Training and Resources**: It facilitates extensive training for law enforcement and public awareness programs, enhancing the overall effectiveness in managing and preventing cases of missing and murdered indigenous persons.\n\n5. **Inclusive and Broad Focus**: The gender-inclusive language and the broad categorization of indigenous populations ensure that the law covers all affected individuals without bias, promoting equality and comprehensive support.\n\nThese aspects of the legislation collectively strengthen the systemic approach to a longstanding issue, aiming to reduce the number of unresolved cases and improve community trust in law enforcement and government agencies.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation, despite its many strengths, also has several potential drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Explicit Evaluation Mechanisms**: The legislation does not explicitly include detailed mechanisms for evaluation, such as final reports, structured monitoring, or a Tribal Crisis Response Plan (TCRP). This omission could impact the ability to measure the effectiveness of the law\u2019s implementation and to refine or scale approaches based on reliable data and feedback.\n\n2. **Limited Consultation and Inclusion**: The legislation does not specifically detail input or consultation with MMIP survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or broader indigenous communities in its development. This could result in a lack of alignment with the needs and experiences of those most affected by the issue, potentially limiting the law\u2019s effectiveness and acceptance within indigenous communities.\n\n3. **Dependency on Federal Funding**: The establishment and operational success of the Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons are heavily dependent on securing federal funding. This reliance could pose a risk if such funding is delayed, reduced, or not granted, thereby impeding the initiative's intended impacts.\n\n4. **Potential for Limited Reach and Impact**: While the legislation aims to coordinate among state, tribal, and federal law enforcement, there may be challenges in implementing these collaborations effectively across various jurisdictions, which could lead to inconsistent application and limitations in reaching all affected communities.\n\nOverall, while the legislation represents a significant step forward in addressing the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons, these drawbacks highlight areas that could be improved for more robust and inclusive action.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"No",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"The legislation does not specifically mention mechanisms such as a final report, consultation with community, tribal consultation, a Tribal Crisis Response Plan (TCRP), monitoring, or data collection. However, there are mentions that could be interpreted as related to evaluation in a broad sense:\n\n1. \"The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation shall coordinate with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office and the United States Department of Justice to obtain federal funding **by January 1, 2022**, to coordinate efforts and gather data to address the issue of missing and murdered indigenous persons in the State of Oklahoma.\" (This indicates a timeline and data gathering which could imply an aspect of monitoring or evaluation.)\n\n2. \"Consult with community organizations that serve indigenous populations to promote community relations and develop best practices.\" (This suggests a form of ongoing engagement and consultation, which could be part of an evaluative process.)\n\nThese points suggest elements that support ongoing efforts which indirectly could involve evaluation, but do not explicitly detail structured evaluation mechanisms such as reports, monitoring systems, or detailed data collection analysis as asked in the query.",
    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"Yes, the legislation uses gender-inclusive language by referring to \"missing and murdered indigenous persons\" rather than specifying a particular gender, thus encompassing all individuals irrespective of gender. Terms like \"American Indian individuals\" and \"indigenous populations\" are used, which are inclusive and broad. This approach ensures the focus is on the entire indigenous community affected by such crises.",
    "Prevention Efforts?":"Yes",
    "Prevention Efforts":"\"6. Facilitate trainings for law enforcement and members of the public on issues relating to missing and murdered indigenous persons; and  \n7. Consult with community organizations that serve indigenous populations to promote community relations and develop best practices.\"",
    "Level of Survivor \/ Relative Input":"Somewhat",
    "Centering of Indigenous Voices":"No.\n\nThe legislation does not explicitly reference or indicate any input or consultation with MMIP survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, Indigenous politicians (besides the sponsor mentioned), or Indigenous communities in the development or crafting of the bill. The text focuses primarily on the operational aspects related to the establishment of the Office of Liaison for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons and its duties, without mentioning specific contributions or consultations with these stakeholders. The absence of such details in the text suggests no direct involvement or input from these groups in the legislative process as described.",

    "UIC Pros":"Bill includes gender inclusive language, mentions preventative efforts, and is sponsored by a Native American state senator. ",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation lacks structure that calls for the inclusion and centering of survivors or relatives of MMIP on the task force. Language throughout alludes to recommendations to federally recognized tribes in the state to reduce the cases of MMIP.

    "Summary":"Creates the Task Force on Missing and Murdered Chicago Women; the Task Force must examine and report on the following: (1) the systemic causes behind violence that Chicago women and girls experience; (2) appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Chicago women and girls; (3) policies and institutions such as policing, child welfare, medical examiner practices, and other governmental practices that impact violence against Chicago women and girls and the investigation and prosecution of crimes of gender-related violence against Chicago residents; (4) measures necessary to address and reduce violence against Chicago women and girls; and (5) measures to help victims, victims' families, and victims' communities prevent and heal from violence that occurs against Chicago women and girls.",
    "UIC Pros":"Task force is convened indefinitely, with a mandate to report annually in requiring reports to the General Assembly and the Governor on the work of the Task Force. Bill mandates for the examination of the systemic causes behind disproportionately high levels of violence that Chicago women and girls experience. Bill possesses other commendable mandates, such as the directive to research and report on appropriate methods for tracking and collecting data on violence against Chicago women and girls, including data on missing and murdered Chicago women and girls. ",
    "UIC Cons":"Co-opts language of MMIP advocacy without actually mentioning indigeneity. Further, there is no mention of race and the ways this can enhance the disparate impacts of the missing and murdered crisis. As such, if there is potential to impact urban Indigenous populations in the Chicago area, it will only be by chance. No language stipulating the requirement of cultural relevance of services or approaches. Language is not inclusive of gender diversity. Bill disproportionately centers law enforcement and Chicago bureaucracy, prioritizing knowledge from police and governmental institutions over the lived experiences of indigenous people, failing to center Indigenous voices and perspectives. Reach of this legislation is limited, impacting only Indigenous communities within the Chicago area, not Indigenous populations statewide.",

    "UIC Pros":"- Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs) will be locally tailored with ample opportunity for tribal input. There is explicit mention of preventive measures, survivor services, and education programs that can be implemented across Alaska to reduce rates of violence against and within Indigenous communities. Formulation of TCRP's utilizes a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, with the structure of these plans centering Indigenous populations, oftentimes left out by legislation on a community level. The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures. With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e - police departments), it is likely that law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before.",
    "UIC Cons":"-The language within disseminated information regarding the TCRP's still appears reactive to MMIP, rather than addressing root causes of ongoing violence.

The committee is mandated to study and propose measures to address violence against indigenous peoples, submitting reports periodically until September 30, 2026. Members won't receive compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses. Funding is allocated through appropriations to the attorney general.",
    "UIC Pros":"Representation and Inclusion: Indigenous people are directly represented in the study committee, both in the house and the senate, ensuring that their voices are heard in discussions about issues affecting them.\nHolistic Approach:The comprehensive study and ongoing reviews address various aspects of violence against indigenous peoples, including missing and murdered individuals, allowing for a holistic understanding of the problem.\n",
    "UIC Cons":"Limited Timeline: The timeline for submitting reports and the repeal of the study committee by September 30, 2026, may be considered relatively short. Critics might argue that a more extended period is necessary to conduct a thorough study and implement effective measures.\nFunding Dependency: The use of appropriated monies may be subject to limitations, and critics may argue that greater financial resources are needed for a more robust and sustained effort.\nPotential for Incomplete Representation: While efforts are made to include indigenous representatives, critics may argue that the selection process might not fully capture the diversity of indigenous communities, potentially leaving some voices unheard.\nLack of Compensation: Committee members not being eligible for compensation might be seen as a drawback, as it could limit the ability of individuals, especially those from less privileged backgrounds, to actively participate.\nFocus on Gender Violence: The emphasis on crimes of gender violence may be viewed as limiting, and critics might argue that a broader focus on all forms of violence against indigenous peoples is necessary.\nUncertain Impact of Proposed Legislation: While the committee has the authority to propose legislation, the actual impact of these proposed measures on addressing the issues of missing and murdered indigenous peoples remains uncertain until implemented and evaluated.\nPotential for Insufficient Cultural Understanding: Despite efforts to ensure cultural accuracy, critics might express concerns that the study committee, composed of individuals who may not fully represent all cultural nuances, may inadvertently overlook certain cultural aspects in their recommendations.\nDependency on Law Enforcement: The reliance on law enforcement for data collection may raise concerns among some indigenous communities, given historical and systemic issues with law enforcement relationships in these communities. Critics may argue for more community-driven data collection initiatives.",

The Community Response Plans have been backed by the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center (NIWRC).

    "Summary":"Establishes a MMIP task force. Calls for a need to better understand how dynamics in border towns, cities, and towns near or adjacent to reservations with histories of racial tension contribute to the crisis. Calls for data to be accurately reported and captured and more research to be done to fully understand the MMIP crisis and the appropriate recommendations for justice.",
    "UIC Pros":"Powerful language choice is embedded into the policy. The Executive Order recognizes the MMIP crisis is inextricably rooted in the larger, \"complex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples.\" The Order also highlights the complex role New Mexico's border towns have had in the ongoing MMIP crisis, as well as the way interstates running through reservations contribute in exacerbating the issue. Legislation creates a landmark Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force for New Mexico, created with the purpose of developing a state response plan in addressing systematic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation in MMIP. Task force is of considerable size (40 people), comprised of professionals, representatives from tribes, and requires representatives who are Indigenous survivors of violence or a family member of an Indigenous relative who has been a victim of violence, members of the LGBTQ\/2S+ community, and Indigenous youth. ",
    "UIC Cons":"Nonetheless, there is still a disproportionate presence of law enforcement on the task force. Task force members will not be compensated.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"Yes",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"Yes. The task force is directed to form subcommittees, including a Steering Committee, a Data Subcommittee, a Systems Committee, and a Community Impact Subcommittee. The Steering Committee shall compile policy recommendations and legislative proposals. The task force, through the subcommittees, shall develop a MMIP State Response Plan that will advise the Executive Branch on initiatives, programs, amd policy changes that will support implementation of task force report recommendations. The task force is also directed to develop framework for the State Response Plan and present proposed legislation to the appropriate legislative interim committees and the Governor as soon as possible.",

    "Summary":"This legislation, SB 211, relates to the Alaska Police Standards Council, the Department of Public Safety, and the duties of the attorney general. It establishes the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons Review Commission and requires a report on investigative resources for cases involving these groups. The bill also includes provisions for training, collaboration, and reporting related to missing and murdered indigenous individuals. It establishes a grant program for Alaska tribes to address issues related to missing and murdered indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons. The legislation also outlines confidentiality rules, meeting procedures, and transition terms for the Review Commission.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation, SB 211, brings attention to the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons by establishing a dedicated Review Commission and requiring reports on investigative resources for these cases. It includes inclusive language recognizing the diversity within Indigenous communities, particularly by acknowledging \"two-spirit\" individuals. The establishment of a grant program for Alaska tribes to address issues related to missing and murdered indigenous individuals is a proactive step towards addressing and preventing these cases. Additionally, the emphasis on collaboration and policy recommendations shows a commitment to reducing instances of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons.",
    "UIC Cons":"Based on the provided information and categories, it appears that one potential drawback of the legislation could be the lack of a specific task force dedicated to addressing the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons (MMIP). While the establishment of the Review Commission is a positive step, a dedicated task force could provide additional focused resources and attention to this important issue. Additionally, the legislation may have limitations in addressing the needs and input from MMIP relatives specifically, as it does not explicitly mention a direct focus on their involvement in the decision-making processes. This lack of specific emphasis on direct input from MMIP relatives could be seen as a potential limitation in ensuring their voices and perspectives are fully represented in the implementation of the legislation.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"Yes",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"The legislation does include mechanisms for evaluation. Here is the specific quote from the legislation:\n\n\"The commission shall prepare a biennial report of its findings and recommendations. Not later than the first day of the first regular session of each legislature, the commission shall submit the report to the governor, attorney general, chief justice of the supreme court, senate secretary, and chief clerk of the house of representatives and notify the legislature that the report is available.\"",
    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"Yes. The legislation includes references to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons, indicating a broader focus beyond just women. Additionally, the term \"two-spirit\" is used to acknowledge individuals who do not fit within traditional gender categories. These inclusive terms demonstrate a recognition of the diversity and complexity within Indigenous communities.",
    "Prevention Efforts?":"Yes",
    "Prevention Efforts":"The quoted text from the legislation identifies prevention efforts related to Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons:\n\n\"Sec. 44.41.140. Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons Review Commission. (a) The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Persons Review Commission is established in the Department of Public Safety... (3) make policy, practice, and service recommendations to encourage collaboration and reduce cases involving indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons.\"",

    "Summary":"This legislation designates May 2022 as Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California. It highlights the alarming rates of missing and murdered indigenous cases reported and acknowledges the particularly high murder rates faced by indigenous women in tribal communities. The resolution points out the lack of comprehensive data on this issue, especially concerning indigenous people in urban areas. It references a 2018 report by the Urban Indian Health Institute, noting significant findings about the demographics of the victims in urban cities, including California's ranking with the sixth highest death rate of indigenous women. Finally, it calls for the distribution of this resolution for appropriate awareness and action.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation for Missing and Murdered Indigenous People Awareness Month in California offers several benefits:\n\n1. **Raises Awareness:** It designates May 2022 as a specific month to focus public attention on the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous people, thereby increasing public awareness and understanding of an often-overlooked issue.\n\n2. **Acknowledges a Critical Issue:** This resolution acknowledges the high rates of violence faced by indigenous people, particularly women in tribal communities, and the lack of comprehensive data on the broader crisis, especially in urban areas.\n\n3. **Promotes Gender Inclusivity:** By using the term \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous People,\" the legislation adopts gender-inclusive language, recognizing that the issue transcends gender and affects the wider indigenous community.\n\n4. **Highlights the Need for Better Data:** By referencing specific reports and statistics, it underscores the critical need for improved data collection and analysis to understand the scope of the issue fully and mobilize resources effectively.\n\n5. **Calls for Action:** Though it mainly serves to raise awareness, the legislation implicitly calls for further action by highlighting the significance of the problem and distributing the resolution for appropriate awareness and response, paving the way for future measures to address the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation, while beneficial in raising awareness and acknowledgment of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People (MMIP), presents certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Mechanisms for Evaluation**: The absence of specified mechanisms for ongoing evaluation, such as data monitoring or a final report, means there is no structured way to assess the effectiveness of the awareness month or the progress made toward addressing the issues it highlights.\n\n2. **No Direct Action or Policy Change**: The legislation focuses on designation and awareness without mandating specific actions, initiatives, or policy changes aimed at directly combating the problem or supporting MMIP survivors and their families.\n\n3. **Limited Involvement from Impacted Communities**: There is no indication of consultation with or input from MMIP survivors, their relatives, or Indigenous communities in the drafting of the legislation. This omission could mean missed opportunities for incorporating valuable insights and ensuring the measures fully address the communities' needs and perspectives.\n\nThese drawbacks highlight areas where the legislation, despite its contributions to raising awareness, may fall short in enacting substantial change or directly addressing the root causes and consequences of the MMIP crisis.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"No",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"As per my previous response indicating that the legislation does not include mechanisms for evaluation, I am unable to provide a quote or create a numbered list of evaluation mechanisms from the provided legislation text.",
    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"Yes, the legislation uses gender-inclusive language by referring to \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous People\" rather than focusing solely on women, thus including all genders within the crisis scope. It consistently uses the term \"people\" when addressing the issue, emphasizing an inclusive approach. This broadens the awareness and scope of the resolution beyond gender-specific language.",
    "Prevention Efforts?":"No",
    "Prevention Efforts":"No.",
    "Level of Survivor \/ Relative Input":"No",
    "Centering of Indigenous Voices":"No.\n\nThe text of the legislation does not specifically mention any consultation or input from MMIP (Missing and Murdered Indigenous People) survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or Indigenous communities in general in the drafting or resolution of this legislation. It mainly focuses on awareness and acknowledgment of the issue rather than detailing participatory processes or contributions from these groups. Therefore, there is no evidence within the provided text of direct engagement or input from these communities in its creation.",

    "Summary":"The legislation establishes a task force in New York State to address the issue of missing women and girls who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). This task force will consist of various state officials and appointed members who reflect the diverse and directly impacted communities. It is charged with developing policy changes to improve governmental agency responses, advancing community knowledge, collecting data, and recommending safety and preventive measures. The task force will engage the public through hearings and written submissions and will produce a report with findings and recommendations within two years. The act will take effect 60 days after becoming law and expire three years thereafter.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation primarily benefits the community by setting up a structured approach to address the critical issue of missing BIPOC women and girls in New York State. Key advantages include:\n\n1. **Establishment of a Task Force**: The creation of a task force brings together various state officials and stakeholders who can focus resources and expertise on this specific issue, promising a targeted and informed approach.\n\n2. **Policy Development**: The task force is tasked with developing policy changes to improve how governmental agencies handle these cases, potentially leading to more effective and sensitive handling of such cases, thus potentially reducing the number of cases overall.\n\n3. **Community Engagement and Education**: The legislation mandates that the task force engage with communities through public hearings and accept written input, enhancing community involvement and ensuring that the policies developed are informed by those most affected.\n\n4. **Data Collection**: By developing strategies for better data collection, the task force can help provide a clearer picture of the scope of the problem, which is crucial for developing effective interventions and policies.\n\n5. **Preventive Measures and Awareness**: The task force will recommend preventive measures and conduct awareness campaigns that could educate the public on the risks and signs of trafficking and abduction, thereby potentially reducing the number of future victims.\n\n6. **Report with Findings and Recommendations**: The requirement for the task force to submit a comprehensive report ensures accountability and provides a structured evaluation of the effectiveness of the implemented measures.\n\nThese benefits are aimed at addressing systemic issues, providing education, improving safety, and ensuring better data handling related to the crisis of missing BIPOC women and girls.",
    "UIC Cons":"The previously mentioned legislation, while providing several potential benefits for addressing the issue of missing BIPOC women and girls in New York State, also presents certain drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Gender-Inclusive Language**: The legislation specifically focuses on women and girls, omitting non-binary and other gender identities within the BIPOC communities who might also be affected by similar issues.\n\n2. **Limited Stakeholder Inclusion**: There is no explicit mention of direct involvement from MMIP survivors, relatives of MMIP survivors, or Indigenous politicians in the formation and operation of the task force. This could potentially limit the effectiveness of the task force by not incorporating a wide range of experiences and insights from those most affected by such crises.\n\n3. **Short Duration of the Act's Effectiveness**: The legislation is set to expire three years after enactment. This limited timeframe might constrain the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the initiatives undertaken by the task force.\n\n4. **Potential Lack of Comprehensive Impact**: Without direct input from Indigenous communities and leaders, there's a risk that the policies and strategies developed may not fully address the specific needs and cultural considerations of the communities intended to benefit from the legislation.\n\n5. **Lack of Federal Coordination Mentioned**: While the task force focuses on a state-level response, it does not specify collaboration with federal agencies, potentially missing opportunities for broader impact through alignment with national initiatives for missing BIPOC individuals.\n\nThese drawbacks suggest areas where the legislation might be improved to ensure broader inclusivity and a more impactful, sustainable approach to tackling the issue of missing BIPOC women and girls.",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation?":"Yes",
    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"1. **Final report**: \"On or before two years after the effective date of this act, the task force shall submit to the temporary president of the senate, the speaker of the assembly, the minority leader of the senate and the minority leader of the assembly a report containing its findings and recommendations.\"\n   \n2. **Consultation with community**: \"In carrying out the duties of the task force, such task force shall seek public input by holding public hearings in each region of the state and accepting public input in writing.\"\n\n3. **Data collection**: \"(iv) develop a strategy to collect statistics, demographics, surveys, oral histories, and data analysis.\"",

    "UIC Pros":"Positive changes and updates from VAWA 2018. VAWA 2013 did not apply to Alaska Native villages with the exception of two tribes, so allowing Alaska Native villages to be covered by the proposed legislation was a critical change. Changed from VAWA 2018 is the name \"Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ),\" which is now proposed as \"Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction,\" thus providing a clarification as to who these provisions are for (tribal communities). New VAWA legislation respond to concerns raised by the National Congress of American Indians, as well as other community members regarding the number of tribes that can implement SDVCJ because of the costs of meeting congressionally delegated standards. The new version of VAWA proposes the allocation of money to tribal communities. This bill has expanded tribal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous offenders for crimes which were not previously included in the SDVCJ of the 2013 reauthorization. These include trafficking, child abuse, child witness of abuse, stalking, sexual assault, elder abuse, and assault against law enforcement.",

    "Summary":"The proposed legislation establishes a reward fund in the Minnesota state treasury to provide financial incentives for information related to cases of missing and murdered Indigenous relatives. This fund will be managed by the director of the Office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives, who will consult with a specifically appointed advisory group consisting of various representatives from Indigenous and related organizations. The advisory group will meet at least twice per year to make recommendations on the distribution of rewards, which are capped at an unspecified amount. Up to four percent of the fund can be used for public awareness campaigns about the rewards. The legislation includes an appropriation of $110,000 from the general fund for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, to implement this program.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation offers several notable benefits:\n\n1. **Financial Incentives for Information**: By establishing a reward fund in the Minnesota state treasury, the legislation incentivizes public cooperation in providing information related to missing and murdered Indigenous relatives. This could potentially lead to breakthroughs in unresolved cases and closure for families.\n\n2. **Managed by a Dedicated Office**: The creation of the Office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives ensures focused and specialized management of both the reward program and the broader issues surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous individuals.\n\n3. **Community and Expert Involvement**: The advisory group, consisting of representatives from tribal and local organizations who work directly with the impacted communities, provides a platform for informed decision-making and recommendations on the distribution of rewards.\n\n4. **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Allocating up to four percent of the fund for public awareness increases visibility of the issues surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous persons, potentially driving more community engagement and preventive actions.\n\n5. **Inclusive and Broad Scope**: The use of gender-inclusive language and the general focus on Indigenous people rather than specifying gender make the legislation inclusive, acknowledging the crisis affecting all Indigenous persons, not just women and girls.\n\n6. **Legislative Support from Indigenous Representatives**: Having legislation sponsored by Indigenous politicians, such as Senator Mary Kunesh, adds credibility and likely a more profound understanding of the cultural aspects and needs of the Indigenous communities affected by this crisis.\n\nThese facets demonstrate a well-rounded approach focusing on both solving current cases through financial incentives and preventing future cases via awareness and inclusive community engagement.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation, while beneficial in several aspects, also presents certain drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Evaluation Mechanisms**: The absence of clear, articulated mechanisms such as finalized reports, tribal consultations, crisis response plans, monitoring, or structured data collection processes limits the ability to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of the legislation systematically. This could hinder accountability and continual improvement of the program.\n\n2. **Unspecified Reward Cap**: Although the legislation mentions a cap on rewards, it does not specify the maximum amount. This vagueness could lead to uncertainty in budget planning and potential inconsistencies in reward distribution.\n\n3. **Limited Direct Input from MMIP Survivors and Relatives**: The legislation does not explicitly ensure the involvement or input of MMIP survivors or relatives of MMIP survivors in the advisory group or legislative process. This may result in policies that do not fully address the specific needs or experiences of those most affected by the crisis.\n\n4. **Potential Underfunding**: The allocated budget of $110,000 might be insufficient to cover extensive public awareness campaigns, manage the reward fund effectively, support the advisory group, and meet other logistical and administrative requirements necessary to execute the program optimally.\n\n5. **Focused on Information Rewards Rather Than Holistic Prevention**: The primary focus on financial rewards for information may not adequately address broader preventive measures or tackle underlying systemic issues that contribute to the high rates of violence against Indigenous people.\n\nThese limitations suggest areas where the legislation may need further refinement or augmentation to maximize its effectiveness and responsiveness to the needs of the Indigenous community regarding missing and murdered relatives.",

    "Mechanisms for Evaluation":"Yes; this bill has a provision for a reward advisory group",

    "Summary":"The proposed legislation in New York aims to establish a task force to address the issue of missing Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) women and girls. This task force, comprised of appointed government representatives and members reflecting the diversity of New York, will assess and suggest policy changes, educate communities, and develop protection strategies specifically tailored to the needs of BIPOC individuals. Key areas for the task force include improving cultural competency among first responders, collecting relevant data and statistics, and identifying high-risk areas. Public input will be solicited through hearings and written submissions to ensure broad community engagement. A comprehensive report detailing findings and recommendations will be submitted to key legislative leaders and made available to the public two years after the enactment of the legislation, which is set to expire after three years.",
    "UIC Pros":"The proposed legislation in New York focuses on addressing the critical issue of missing Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) women and girls through several beneficial approaches:\n\n1. **Establishment of a Task Force**: Creating a specialized task force composed of government and community representatives dedicated to this issue ensures focused and continuous attention on the crisis, promoting systemic changes.\n\n2. **Community Involvement and Public Input**: By involving the community and seeking public input through hearings and written submissions, the legislation ensures that a broad spectrum of perspectives, particularly from affected communities, inform its strategies and recommendations.\n\n3. **Data Collection and Analysis**: The development of strategies to collect and analyze relevant data, including statistics, demographics, and oral histories, will help provide a more accurate understanding of the scope and specifics of the issue, aiding in the formulation of effective interventions.\n\n4. **Educational and Preventive Measures**: The legislation prioritizes education and training for BIPOC communities on prevention and protection, specifically regarding the risks associated with social media. It also advocates for preventive programming to advance the safety of women and girls.\n\n5. **Awareness Campaign**: The initiation of a state-wide awareness campaign aims to increase general awareness, educate the public, and potentially drive broader change through heightened visibility of the issue.\n\n6. **Policy Development and Cultural Competency**: Recommendations for policy changes, especially in improving cultural competency among first responders, address the need for more sensitive and effective handling of cases involving BIPOC women and girls.\n\nOverall, the legislation provides a structured approach to tackle the disappearance and harm of BIPOC women and girls, fostering potential long-term improvements in community safety, awareness, and systemic state response to such crises.",
    "UIC Cons":"The legislation designed to address the issue of missing BIPOC women and girls in New York, while well-intentioned, faces several potential drawbacks:\n\n1. **Lack of Specific Inclusion of Indigenous Input**: The legislation does not explicitly include Indigenous politicians, MMIP survivors, or relatives of MMIP in the drafting or operational stages of the task force. This omission could result in solutions that are not fully informed by the experiences and needs of the communities most affected by the crisis.\n\n2. **Narrow Scope on Gender**: By focusing solely on women and girls, the legislation does not address missing Indigenous individuals in a gender-neutral context, potentially overlooking non-female victims who also require attention and resources.\n\n3. **Limited Longevity and Follow-up**: The task force and its initiatives are set to expire three years after the legislation becomes law. This finite timeline might not allow enough duration for the task force to fully implement long-term changes or to see the long-term efficacy of their initiatives.\n\n4. **Potential Resource Allocation Challenges**: The funding specifics for implementing the initiatives, such as compensation for task force members' expenses, educational programs, and awareness campaigns, are not detailed. This could lead to financial challenges that might impede the task force\u2019s operations.\n\n5. **Vague Measures for Cultural Competency**: While the legislation aims to improve cultural competency among first responders, it does not provide specific guidelines or criteria for achieving this, which could result in inconsistent applications and effectiveness.\n\nThese drawbacks suggest that the legislation might benefit from revisions to more inclusively address the complexities of the issues facing missing BIPOC individuals and to enhance the sustainability and impact of the proposed measures.",

    "Summary":"The proposed legislation aims to establish the \"Office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives\" in Minnesota, which will advocate for, develop, and enforce initiatives outlined in the \"Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force Report\" from 2020. The office\u2019s duties include developing legislative recommendations, facilitating research, reviewing cases of violence against indigenous people, and coordinating with state, local, tribal, and federal agencies. It is led by an executive director appointed by the governor, who has the autonomy to hire necessary staff to fulfill the office\u2019s duties. The office will report annually on its activities and outcomes, and it can apply for grants to support its operations. Funding for the office for fiscal years 2022 and 2023 will be appropriated from the general fund, amounting to be determined later.",
    "UIC Pros":"The legislation provides several significant benefits:\n\n1. **Establishment of a Dedicated Office**: The creation of the \"Office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives\" centralizes efforts and resources, enhancing the focus on the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous persons. This specialized office can provide a more coordinated and effective response.\n\n2. **Comprehensive Duties and Advocacy**: The office is tasked with a broad range of duties from advocacy in legislative processes to the development of tools for evaluating the implementation of its initiatives. This ensures that multiple aspects of the issue, such as legal reforms and inter-agency coordination, are addressed systematically.\n\n3. **Data Access and Research**: By having access to crucial data and the mandate to facilitate research, the office can make informed decisions and recommendations. This data-driven approach could lead to more effective strategies to combat the issues faced by indigenous communities concerning violence and disappearances.\n\n4. **Annual Reporting**: The requirement for the office to produce annual reports on its measurable outcomes ensures transparency and accountability. This not only helps in keeping the public and stakeholders informed but also assists in continuous improvement of efforts based on past performances.\n\n5. **Inclusion and Representation**: The appointing of an executive director who is deeply connected with the indigenous community and the recommendation to consider candidates from these communities enhance representation. This inclusion ensures that the strategies and actions of the office are reflective of and sensitive to the needs and perspectives of indigenous peoples.\n\n6. **Funding and Resource Allocation**: With appropriations from the general fund and the ability to apply for grants, the office is financially empowered to carry out its duties effectively, ensuring sustained efforts towards addressing the crisis.\n\nThis combination of focused oversight, community involvement, resource allocation, and comprehensive duties under a dedicated office makes the legislation a robust framework for addressing the critical issue of missing and murdered indigenous relatives in Minnesota.",
    "UIC Cons":"The previously mentioned legislation, while comprehensive in many respects, also presents potential drawbacks or cons:\n\n1. **Potential Funding Challenges**: The legislation requires appropriations from the general fund, but the exact amount is undecided, which can lead to potential funding uncertainties. Reliance on unspecified future appropriations and grants might hinder the office's ability to plan long-term initiatives effectively.\n\n2. **Bureaucratic Complexity**: The establishment of a new office with expansive duties could lead to increased bureaucratic processes. The layers of coordination, both within the state and with multiple agencies, might slow down decision-making and response times.\n\n3. **Scope of Authority and Enforcement**: While the office has a broad mandate, its actual power to enforce its recommendations or compel other agencies and organizations to act is not clearly defined. This could limit its effectiveness in bringing about real change.\n\n4. **Vague Metrics for Success**: Although the office is required to report measurable outcomes, the criteria for these measurements are not specified in detail. This might lead to challenges in evaluating the office\u2019s effectiveness and accountability.\n\n5. **Limited Focus on Prevention**: The legislation heavily focuses on addressing cases after they have occurred rather than on preventive measures. This might leave gaps in efforts to tackle the root causes of the crisis affecting missing and murdered indigenous relatives.\n\n6. **Community Involvement Ambiguity**: While the legislation emphasizes the inclusion of indigenous perspectives in the leadership selection, it doesn't explicitly mandate ongoing community involvement or feedback mechanisms in the office's operations, potentially limiting community buy-in and relevance.\n\nThese drawbacks highlight the importance of ensuring robust funding, clear authority, and active community engagement in the office's ongoing efforts to address the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous relatives effectively.",

    "Gender Inclusive Language?":"Yes",
    "Gender Inclusive Language":"The legislation uses gender-inclusive language by referring to \"missing and murdered indigenous relatives\" and \"indigenous people\" rather than specifically focusing only on women.

    "Summary":"Concerning responding to the missing indigenous persons crisis, and, in connection therewith, establishing the office of liaison for missing and murdered indigenous relatives and making an appropriation.",
    "UIC Pros":"The bill demonstrates a commitment to addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous persons by establishing the Office of Liaison, signaling increased awareness and attention to the issue. This dedicated office provides specialized support for investigations and cases involving Indigenous victims, promoting culturally sensitive approaches. The legislation actively involves the community through a Community Volunteer Advisory Board, ensuring Indigenous-led organizations contribute to addressing the problem. Emphasizing collaboration with various stakeholders, including law enforcement, tribes, and Indigenous-led organizations, the bill aims to overcome jurisdictional barriers. Mandating training for peace officers and creating a clearinghouse database, the legislation seeks to improve responses and facilitate efficient investigations, while promoting a trauma-informed and victim-centered approach to address the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"\nQuestions may arise about who qualifies as indigenous and whether the legislation effectively encompasses all relevant cases. Some may argue that enhancing existing agencies might be more prudent than creating new structures like an office and advisory board. Privacy concerns include the legislation granting access to sensitive records, concerns for the potential misuse of confidential data. Mandated training for peace officers might face skepticism regarding its practicality, effectiveness, and associated costs. Additionally, coordination challenges in collaborating with tribal governments, federal agencies, and law enforcement may be questioned for feasibility and effectiveness, especially in cases involving jurisdictional conflicts or conflicting interests. Skepticism may extend to the long-term sustainability of proposed initiatives, with critics questioning whether adequate funding will be sustained over time. The legislation lacks clear enforcement mechanisms or consequences for non-compliance, potentially diminishing its effectiveness. Lastly, the frequency and content of reports may be insufficient or not comprehensive enough to address the complexities of the issue.",

    "Summary":"Alaska's MMIP Pilot Project implements tailored Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRP) in select pilot sites. Sites include the tribal communities of Curyung Native Council (Dillingham), Native Village of Unalakleet, and Koyukuk Native Village. AK's MMIP Pilot Program",
    "UIC Pros":"Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs) will be locally tailored with ample opportunity for tribal input. There is explicit mention of preventive measures, survivor services, and education programs that can be implemented across Alaska to reduce rates of violence against and within Indigenous communities. Formulation of TCRP's utilizes a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, with the structure of these plans centering Indigenous populations, oftentimes left out by legislation on a community level. The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures. With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e - police departments), it is likely that law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before. ",
    "UIC Cons":"The language within disseminated information regarding the TCRP's still appears reactive to MMIP, rather than addressing root causes of ongoing violence. The heavy police emphasis on collaboration with law enforcement may limit the kinds of \"justice\" that can come from these community response plans. ",
