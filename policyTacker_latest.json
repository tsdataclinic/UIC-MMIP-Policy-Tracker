    "UIC Pros":"Tribal Community Response Plans (TCRPs) will be locally tailored with ample opportunity for tribal input. There is explicit mention of preventive measures, survivor services, and education programs that can be implemented across Alaska to reduce rates of violence against and within Indigenous communities. Formulation of TCRP's utilizes a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, with the structure of these plans centering Indigenous populations, oftentimes left out by legislation on a community level. The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures. With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e - police departments), it is likely that law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before. ",
    "UIC Cons":"The language within disseminated information regarding the TCRP's still appears reactive to MMIP, rather than addressing root causes of ongoing violence.

Both pieces of legislation also appropriate money for these causes. ",
    "UIC Pros":"- This piece of legislation calls for draft legislation to be produced, which takes action a step further from just recommendations. The Office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives further requires the reporting on measurable outcomes achieved to meet its statutory duties along with an annual report.\n- Legislation is a landmark in the creation of the Office for Missing and Murdered Indigenous\u200b Relatives. UIC is not aware of many other states in the nation with policy structured to center and empower the Indigenous voices of the MMIP crisis in this way. \n- Fully structured and well developed mandate with research outlined for the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force (in the production of their annual report), as well as the directive to develop tools and processes to evaluate the implementation and impact of the efforts of the office, and drafting of policy to procure the data required for office reviews of cases. \n- Legislation makes financial commitment to the relatives of MMIP through the appropriation of money for these causes. \n\n",

    "UIC Pros":"The bill demonstrates a commitment to addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous persons by establishing the Office of Liaison, signaling increased awareness and attention to the issue. This dedicated office provides specialized support for investigations and cases involving Indigenous victims, promoting culturally sensitive approaches. The legislation actively involves the community through a Community Volunteer Advisory Board, ensuring Indigenous-led organizations contribute to addressing the problem. Emphasizing collaboration with various stakeholders, including law enforcement, tribes, and Indigenous-led organizations, the bill aims to overcome jurisdictional barriers. Mandating training for peace officers and creating a clearinghouse database, the legislation seeks to improve responses and facilitate efficient investigations, while promoting a trauma-informed and victim-centered approach to address the crisis.",
    "UIC Cons":"\nQuestions may arise about who qualifies as indigenous and whether the legislation effectively encompasses all relevant cases. Some may argue that enhancing existing agencies might be more prudent than creating new structures like an office and advisory board. Privacy concerns include the legislation granting access to sensitive records, concerns for the potential misuse of confidential data. Mandated training for peace officers might face skepticism regarding its practicality, effectiveness, and associated costs. Additionally, coordination challenges in collaborating with tribal governments, federal agencies, and law enforcement may be questioned for feasibility and effectiveness, especially in cases involving jurisdictional conflicts or conflicting interests. Skepticism may extend to the long-term sustainability of proposed initiatives, with critics questioning whether adequate funding will be sustained over time. The legislation lacks clear enforcement mechanisms or consequences for non-compliance, potentially diminishing its effectiveness. Lastly, the frequency and content of reports may be insufficient or not comprehensive enough to address the complexities of the issue.",

The structure of these community response plans seem to incorporate accountability to and within Indigenous communities and cultures. With the TCRP outlining objectives that include finding solutions within the criminal legal system (i.e - police departments), it is likely that law enforcement and tribes are brought together to work on issues of MMIP in a capacity in which they may not have been before.",

This Bill mandates that the criminal justice training commission shall collaborate with the two liaisons for missing and murdered indigenous persons pursuant to RCW 43.43.874 to provide training to law enforcement officers and county coroners in tribal sovereignty, customs, culture, traditions, and spirituality, to facilitate compliance with proper conduct in varying situations involving missing or murdered peoples. Further, the Washington state patrol shall establish and maintain a missing children and endangered person clearinghouse which shall include the maintenance and operation of a toll-free telephone hotline and develop and implement a plan, commonly known as an \"amber alert plan\" or an \"endangered missing person advisory plan\"  to enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Lastly the bill calls for the department of commerce's office of crime victims advocacy to award grant funding to establish a pilot project providing wraparound services to indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking as well as grant funding to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking (introduced on 4\/5\/21-died in committee).

The new version of VAWA proposes the allocation of $ to tribal communities.\n- This bill has expanded tribal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous offenders for crimes which were not previously included in the SDVCJ of the 2013 reauthorization.

    "Summary":"*Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signs Executive Order 2021-013 recognizing the MMIWR crisis in New Mexico and beyond as inextricably rooted in the larger, complex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples, the need to improve the working relationships between tribal nations and law enforcement agencies, the critical need for enhanced data to illuminate the crisis, and establishing the New Mexico Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force. This task force is created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents (promulgated 5\/5\/21).",
    "UIC Pros":"- Powerful language choice is embedded into the policy, with the Executive Order recognizing the MMIWR crisis as inextricably rooted in the larger, \u201ccomplex history of state-sanctioned colonial violence against Indigenous peoples.\u201d The Order also highlights the complex role New Mexico\u2019s border towns have had in the ongoing MMIP crisis, as well as the way interstates running through reservations contribute to exacerbating the issue.\n- Legislation creates a landmark Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Relatives Task Force for New Mexico, created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents\n- Taskforce is of considerable size (40), comprised of professionals, representatives from tribes, and a requirement for representatives who are Indigenous survivors of violence or family members of an Indigenous relative who has been a victim of violence, members of the LGBTQ\/2S+ community, and Indigenous youth (although capped at 5 members). Nonetheless, there is still a disproportionate presence of law enforcement on the task force (a drawback for UIC).\n- There are action items that hold the task force accountable, such as the requirement that through the subcommittees, the task force will develop a MMIWR State Response Plan as well as present proposed legislation to the appropriate legislative interim committees and the Governor \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n",

In this way there is encouraging attention paid to prevention. ",
    "UIC Cons":"- The legislation lacks a structure that calls for the inclusion or centering of survivors or relatives of MMIP on the task force. The bill generally fails to amplify voices from the Indigenous community.\n- Legislative language alludes that recommendations will be made to federally recognized tribes in the state to reduce cases of missing and murdered indigenous persons, however this serves to obscure the structural conditions facilitating and motivating the ongoing MMIP crisis, even suggesting that tribal communities are, themselves, to blame for the violence waged against their Indigenous populations.   \n- May preclude authentic Indigenous representation because task force members must be appointed by Attorney General, in this way the legislation falls short in centering the voices of survivors and relatives",

    "UIC Pros":"Positive changes and updates from VAWA 2018. VAWA 2013 did not apply to Alaska Native villages with the exception of two tribes, so allowing Alaska Native villages to be covered by the proposed legislation was a critical change. Changed from VAWA 2018 is the name \"Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ),\" which is now proposed as \"Special Tribal Criminal Jurisdiction,\" thus providing a clarification as to who these provisions are for (tribal communities). New VAWA legislation respond to concerns raised by the National Congress of American Indians, as well as other community members regarding the number of tribes that can implement SDVCJ because of the costs of meeting congressionally delegated standards. The new version of VAWA proposes the allocation of money to tribal communities. This bill has expanded tribal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous offenders for crimes which were not previously included in the SDVCJ of the 2013 reauthorization. These include trafficking, child abuse, child witness of abuse, stalking, sexual assault, elder abuse, and assault against law enforcement.",

This Bill mandates conducting consultations with tribal governments on the scope and nature of the issues regarding murdered and missing indigenous women and girls; develop model protocols and procedures to apply to new and unsolved cases of murdered or missing indigenous women and girls, including the best practices for improving the way law enforcement investigators and prosecutors respond to the high volume of the cases, and to the investigative challenges that might be presented in cases involving female victims; practices for collecting and sharing data among various jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies; better use of existing criminal databases. The task force will also seek input from representatives from tribal law enforcement and federal agencies to review cold cases involving murdered and missing indigenous women and girls; and address the need for greater clarity concerning roles, authorities, and jurisdiction throughout the lifecycle of cases involving murdered and missing indigenous women and girls. (passed on 3\/17\/21)",
    "UIC Pros":"+This Bill mandates conducting consultations with tribal governments on the scope and nature of the issues regarding murdered and missing indigenous women and girls, as well as the development of model protocols and procedures to apply to new and unsolved cases of MMIWG\n+ The bill mandates the collection and sharing of data among various jurisdictions and law enforcement agencies with the aims of improving the use of existing criminal databases\n+ Action items such as the requirement for the production of a report including a summary of the task force's findings and recommendations for improvements in the criminal justice and social service systems for preventing and addressing crimes involving murdered and missing Indigenous women and girls in the state\n\n\n",
    "UIC Cons":"- The task force will seek input from representatives from tribal law enforcement and federal agencies to review cold cases involving MMIWG, but the structure of the working group only requires one representative of a Utah Native American tribe. There are no requirements for the inclusion of survivors of families of MMIP.\n- Language in the legislation fails to be gender inclusive, focusing exclusively on women and girls\n- Very limited money dedicated to establishing the taskforce (less than $10K)\n- Education and outreach campaigns are the focus of preventative work carried out by the task force, diverting the structural and material concerns of the MMIP crisis of the necessary attention they need.\n\n\n\n",

The Act also addresses establishing and maintaining a missing children and endangered clearinghouse. Also calls for the Department of Commerce's office of crime victims advocacy to award grant funding for services to indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking as well as to increase visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are victims of trafficking.",
    "UIC Pros":"The Bill does not only focus on the far\/murder end of the crisis concerning violence against Indigenous people with the MMIP crisis, but also includes language focused on Indigenous survivors of human trafficking. This collaboration emphasized within the legislation between the two MMIP liaisons, law enforcement officers, and county coroner's signals enhanced respect for tribes and their relationship with their deceased. Through the MMIP liaison, relatives of MMIP can visit remains and conduct any spiritual practices (as long as it doesn't interfere with an active investigation\/preserving evidence). \"Amber Alert Plan\" or an \"Endangered Missing Person Advisory Plan\" can enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Legislation aims to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking. ",
    "UIC Cons":"Relatives of MMIP cannot conduct any type of ceremony until getting permission from county coroner and lead investigator. The legislation is focused on proper conduct and systematized response once an Indigenous person has already gone missing, with emphasis on roles and cooperation of coroners and law enforcement. There is no mechanism in the text for the centering of indigenous concerns or desires or efforts at prevention. ",
