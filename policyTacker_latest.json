This Bill mandates that the criminal justice training commission shall collaborate with the two liaisons for missing and murdered indigenous persons pursuant to RCW 43.43.874 to provide training to law enforcement officers and county coroners in tribal sovereignty, customs, culture, traditions, and spirituality, to facilitate compliance with proper conduct in varying situations involving missing or murdered peoples. Further, the Washington state patrol shall establish and maintain a missing children and endangered person clearinghouse which shall include the maintenance and operation of a toll-free telephone hotline and develop and implement a plan, commonly known as an \"amber alert plan\" or an \"endangered missing person advisory plan\"  to enhance the public's ability to assist in recovering abducted children, missing indigenous people, and missing endangered persons. Lastly the bill calls for the department of commerce's office of crime victims advocacy to award grant funding to establish a pilot project providing wraparound services to indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking as well as grant funding to increase the visibility and accessibility of services and resources for indigenous persons who are survivors of trafficking (introduced on 4\/5\/21-died in committee).

The new version of VAWA proposes the allocation of $ to tribal communities.\n- This bill has expanded tribal jurisdiction over non-Indigenous offenders for crimes which were not previously included in the SDVCJ of the 2013 reauthorization.

This task force is created with the purpose of developing a state response plan addressing systemic changes that support prevention, reporting, and investigation of MMIWR incidents (promulgated 5\/5\/21).",
